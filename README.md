# Project 1 - CasierVert952

## 0. Initial configuration

### 0.1 Package requiered to run the analysis

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- ...

### 0.2 Data

To be able to reproduce the results by running the 'analysis.ipynb' file, the following directory structure is required:

```
README
analysis.ipynb
helpers.py
data/
├── BeerAdvocate/
│   ├── beers.csv
│   ├── breweries.csv
│   ├── users.csv
│   └── ratings.csv
│
└── RateBeer/
    ├── beers.csv
    ├── breweries.csv
    ├── users.csv
    └── ratings.csv
```

All files can be found in the GitHub Repo or in the original datasets, except for the ```ratings.csv``` files that are too heavy to be placed on GitHub. They can be downloaded here:
- [BeerAdvocate](https://coursedingler.ch/data/BA/ratings.csv)
- [RateBeer](https://coursedingler.ch/data/RB/ratings.csv)

> *The generation of ```ratings.csv``` files for both datasets from ```.txt``` files is possible in ```analysis.ipynb``` but takes ~35 minutes on a high-performance computer.*
