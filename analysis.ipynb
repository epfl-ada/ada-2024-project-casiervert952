By far the best thing this beer has going for it is a truly amazing malty aroma that does not dissapoint. If only the taste delivered the same punch. It has a mild malt taste and is followed by a metallic finish. This could be due to being Ina bottle so I would try again on draft but it did let me down. The body is kind of weak with decent carbonation. I would buy again if the price was right but it didn't strike me as awesome.\n",

      "text: Six pack from George's deli case, always some oddball beer in there. Brewed in Rochester, NY, per the label. &quot;1060&quot; Julian date on the neck of the bottle.Pours quietly into a tulip glass, a murky chestnut brown that glints copper orange when held to the light. A finger of light tan foam rises up, it has a creamy surface texture, but doesn't remain long. Spotty froth around the edges of the glass. Sweet buttered biscuit aroma, and more than a little touch of skunky euro hops lending some grassiness.Toasted grains and specialty malt flavors, nutty and sweet. Fairly soft feel with a slight creamy texture, not bad. Flavors are a little faded and a touch bland, but that could be due to age. Medium dextrinous body, some astringency, light carb that seems to ebb away towards the end of the glass.Overall not bad, a couple bottles paired well with charcuterie from the deli.\n",

Fairly light bodied, with a slight watery feel underneath the initial bold flavor profile. The aftertaste is mostly roasted, with the sweet blend of toffee and butterscotch lingering around a bit.

It smelled of caramel and a slight hoppiness. The mouthfeel was thin in body with low carbonation. The taste had hop bitterness up-front that transited to a light, clean watery flavor, with a biscuity aftertaste.

Lacing is fair as well.S- toffee malts and sourdough bread yest like smell. Different and unique. A dark candied fruit like quality as well.F- dark candied fruit and toffe malts. Taste is like smell.M- chewy like a raisin cookie with butter spread on it. It is alright.O- not bad but i didnt expect an irish beer to be as weak as it is on abv.

Smell is complex with fragrances of toffee, dark roasted coffee, carmeal, molasses, malt, and roasted wheat. Taste is slightly on the woody side, like chewing on a branch of oak. There are flavors of molasses, toffee, dark coffee, unsweetened chocolate, butter, grapefruit, and malt. Full mouthfeel, creamy, tart, zingy, a little coating on the sides of my tongue. Good flavored ale with lots of depth, every sip reveals something new. Good beer to sip while watching the sun set after a good day.\n",

The aroma is faint, but some citrus (orange?)is detected. Taste is woody (for lack of a better word), with a standard hop bitterness in the middle and end of the sip. Mouthfeel is medium, and Legbiter finishes bitter and partly dry. Overall, this is a pretty good ale, and it's probably worth a try.RJT\n",

Pretty good head retention.Smell is extremely malt-heavy and slightly sweet. Not bad, but pretty one dimensional. Nothing really stands out or jumps at you here.More of the same in the taste. Very malty with a little bit of hop-bite. It's a little sweet, and there's something almost a bit metallic in the finish.Pretty thin body and mouthfeel. Carbonation tends to fizz on the tongue a bit.I could drink several if I wasn't the one paying for them. I'd take this over a Yuengling, there's a bit more in the way of hops going on when you compare the two.Morey's Bottom Line: I've seen this a lot around town. This bottle was given to me by a friend, and honestly, it's better than i anticipated. I don't think I'd pay for it unless I was super low on cash. It's pretty cheap at less than $5 a sixer!\n",

      "text: Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #40 (May 2010): Mashed in Ireland and fermented in the US ... interesting concept.This brew is clear and tawny with enough head retention to last the session. Butter, toffee, herbal woody hops, toasted bread and a vague fruitiness make for a very aromatic nose. Its fluffy, moderate-size body comes off as a bit wet. The maltiness is dry and goes from toffee to toasted bread crust quickly. Buttery flavors and hop bitterness battle it out as the maltiness settles in as a decent base. Suggestions of apple skin, ripe pears and nut- tiness are in the middle. The buttery character lingers and its maltiness holds together in the dry finish.Good drinking for the Ã¼ber beer geek who does not mind a bit of diacetyl (which is responsible for that buttery flavor).\n",

      "text: Poured from 12oz bottle. A- Pours a brown sludge looking color. One finger light white head that shows light retention. This comes to leave light spotty lacing around the glass with each sip.S- Light caramel malts dominate this beer from start to finish. A light hop in the backing doesn't really balance this beer out after trying. Overall sweetness in the aroma kind of kills any expectations for a pale ale. T- Caramel malts come into play first like I thought they would. This gives way to a light toasted flavor that still for some reason has a sweet taste mixing or following very closely in the middle. A light bitter hop strikes for a second before being overtaken by a sweet caramel malt. M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is low for the style but oddly fits the beer well. Sweet malts dominate everything from the palate to the sweet aftertaste. Off balanced for a pale with sweet malts helping that unbalance. Light alcohol drying on the palate. Flavors were dull and at times felt heavy on the palate.D- It has a low ABV which means I should be able to drink a good amount of it...but I do not care for this beer at all.\n",

      "text: Legbiter poured a dark brown with ruby red highlights. The clarity was excellent, as well as the head. It faded slowly leaving a wall of foam around the edges. The nose was hop heavy up front, but the intensity faded after the initial waft. What remained was a somewhat tinny variety of noble hops, citrus, with a dash of ripened fruit and diacetyl. The first thing evident in the flavor was the buttery character. It was warming, and definitely sharp. Sweet caramel and toffee, wheat bread, and dark sugars made up a deep sweet taste. The feel was very creamy with mild carbonation. The last bit went down foamy, and the finish was filmy and mouthwatering. Bold and sweet, this one is a good sipper. The nose leaves some to be desired, otherwise a very good beer.\n",

      "text: Strangford Lough Brewing: Legbiter (No date) (Tasted 05/20/10)12 oz. twist-off bottle, poured into an imperial pint glass.[Brewed in NY]Appearance: Clear dark amber with hints of brown. Head is off-white, bubbly and relatively persistent, reaching a few millimeters high and retaining a nice hearty millimeter of foam, fat tidemarks around the edge.Odor: Toasted white bread with hints of toffee and red fruit over a backdrop of minerally almost steely aromas. Not picking up much in the way of hops, but that's ok.Consistency: Deceivingly big, medium bodied with a full, rich, malty feel. Carbonation rides low to medium providing a creamy feel.Flavor: Yeast fruitiness is in full effect, providing a back-end to big toasted malt and pale malt sweetness, hints of tobacco. Not much in the way of hop character, suggestions of earthiness, low low low bitterness, barely balancing. Nutty yeast and toasted malt pair in the finish. This feels like it might be categorized incorrectly. It feels like an English brown with some Scottish ale characteristics.No matter what you call it, it is an extremely flavorful beer, especially considering the ABV. Unfortunately, the flavors lean sweet, I feel like this beer would be much better if there was a bit more in the way of bitterness, for balances sake.\n",

      "text: spotted this in the nick of time before making the mistake of ordering a $4 rail mixer. Glad I found it.This beer really confused me at first, because I was expecting a light colored ale. Only when I looked at the style on this site did it make any sense.Poured a semi-translucent brown, head disappeared quickly, but again, a plastic cup didn't do any favors there.Smell was what really threw me off. I had no idea what I was getting into. It smelled like the opposite of an APA -- that is to say that Legbiter was slightly heavier on malt than the hops. Taste was much the same, with an earthen malt flavor, backed up by a disappointingly low amount of bitterness. Hop presence was still there, but more would've been excellent. In my mind, this doesn't quite stack up to SNPA in terms of flavor, but it's definitely the more easy going of the two. More of a session beer in my opinion due to the slightly relaxed flavor.\n",

The flavor jumps out with more hops but blended very nicely with the toffee-caramel sweetness that results in a very pleasant red ale sort of idea. Very drinkable but offering a reasonable dry hop sense, a smooth feel with a medium body, fair carbonation. Just a very pleasant beer overall and more substantial than anticipated. Definitely in the Irish family of Killians only with a more legitimate hop element and better constitution. Recommended for a try if you like this style at all, and generally a brew that should offend few.\n",

The aroma is caramel malt with notes of apple, citrus, fresh cut grass and honey. The taste is biscuity with caramel, apples and grassy, citrus hops, especially toward the finish. Light/medium bodied, fairly smooth and easily drinkable. My bottle was marked brewed and bottled in Rochester, NY rather than Northern Ireland as indicated in previous reviews, and was also darker in color and somewhat maltier than described, although still a decent brew.\n",

      "text: From a Brew only a few years old, of Northern Ireland, 2004. I brought this beer into my Store, Wines Unlimited, where I am the beer manager. Strangford Lough was just recently introduced into the USA, first through CT and RI. The Import owner, Michael Bean owns the rights to both states. Strangford is soon to release in 20 states. Michael Bean, president of the Import Franchise here in CT, brought me some samples, which I liked. The Legbiter, and the St. Patrick's Best. He is hosting a Tasting in our store on March 12th (Friday) 2010, 5pm to 9pm.As for this Beer, the Legbiter:Very refreshing, smooth, medium bodied. Good taste. Pours a nice amber color, with decent head, good retention and a bouquet of aromas are present. The aromas are very fruity, citrus, lavender, floral, some grassy notes, and honey. The taste is strong on the hops, notes of spicy fruits, sweet &amp; salty notes, apples... and some subtle citrus. This is a good beer, and a really good surprise from an Ireland Micro brew, I highly recommend this beer. Not as main stream as Guinness, but can compete with the market if marketed well.Cheers, for good beer.\n",

      "text: 500 ml dark brown bottle. Freshness date on side of label.Note: This beer displayed some over-exuberance upon being released from its captive bottle. A slow, steady bubbly foam arose for about 20 seconds; when we decided to slooowly pour it into pint glasses before we lost any more goodness.It poured a coppery golden color with a nice, thick off-white head with lots of sticky and trailing lace.A full fruity smell is noticed before the pour is complete. Apples come to mind. Light citrus notes, a slight flowery bouquet and grassy malty aromas follow. The aroma lasts and lasts.The flavor however doesn't quite live up to the expectations created by that promising aroma. The fruity taste is quite subdued. A citrusy bitterness mingles with a tart, slightly astringent black tea bite. A mildly bitter lemon rind sourness and an edgy yeasty, cidery taste emerge. A biscuity malt is too far in the background.I had this on cask at NERAX a few years back, and thought I had already rated this beer by that serving type, but I guess I never entered it into BA. However, I do remember it being far mellower and smoothly balanced than this bottled version. All in all, it's a very gulpable brew. Quite refreshing! CypressBob came through...BIG TIME! More unique Irish Ale reviews are coming! Thanks John!\n",

Taste is very hoppy up front, and almost reminiscent of SNPA, wow, this stuff is from Northern Ireland?! The middle is lightly biscuit-like and the finish is all hop oil, and zesty citrus dryness. Small, Irisih hop burps ensue. This is like a west coast pale ale pumped up with goldings instead of cascades....Nice. Mouthfeel is creamy and cask-like in it's real ale qualities and the drinkability is very good. Is this stuff bottle conditioned? Wow, almost like a great SNPA clone made in Northern Ireland. One of the beer worlds little suprises. Only two reviews for this stuff, people get a hold of this brew and rate it! Thanks again Bob, you are truly owed some good things to this one!\n",

It poured with a finger high dense beige head that gradually died down, consistently leaving a thin head covering the surface and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass.S: The smell has light to moderate aromas of toasted malts along with herbal hops and some hints of grassy hops.T: The initial taste has flavors of biscuit and toasted malts along with hints of caramel, toffee and sweetness. This transitions to flavors of earthy yeast and herbal hops, the latter of which contributes a light amount of bitterness.M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate to high amount of carbonation, making it seem a little airy. The earthiness contributes a little dryness towards the finish.O: For a rather light-bodied ale, this beer is packed with lots of flavors. It's extremely easy to drink, which makes this perfectly sessionable.\n",

      "text: Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, this beer is beautiful. A vibrant, crisp, blood-ruby coloring with a slight ring of filmy, off-white head around the edge of the surface. Aromas of toffee richness and a tangy sweetness blend together for a subtle nose. Flavors are bitter forward and all over the tongue, with a subtle, rich toffee backbone that peaks its head around the corner every once in a while to keep things on an even keel. The richness almost has a syrupy quality to its flavor. A light bodied beer, this feels heavier with the richness of the flavors, but somewhat sharp with the carbonation and bitterness. A bittersweet aftertaste, with some roastiness to it. The beer has an almost smokey, light, and crisp finish. Tasty brew.\n",

Listed as produced and bottled, finished in Westport MA with imported Irish ingredients.A nice off tan three finger head off the pour, forms real nicely with a nice cap. Body color is a deep reddish brown color similar to an Irish ale, with nice chestnut hues on the glass.Nice chewy and dense malt on this, a little grassy. Hints of winter warmer like cinnamon, and dry spices.Taste is a bit missing. Faint grassy malt, with a slightly wet body. There's really nothing going on here I wish I could say something. Extremely light even for a bitter, but has a very crisp almost hot aftertaste, where most of the flavor seems to be.Overall, interesting, but not particularly memorable.

      "text: 12 oz bottle of 4.2% ABV beer &quot;from authentic imported Irish ingredients and ... brewed in the USA&quot; (from label). Pours a clear, dark red-brown with a small but lasting beige head. Limited patchy lacing.With the head intact, the aroma seemed far more like a cider than reasonable. As the head dissipated, the aroma remained fruity but less specifically apple and also more floral and malty. A tad earthy with hints of toffee, smoke and herbs. Sweet malt became most prominent with warming. Taste: a nice mix of sweet caramel and toffee malt with spicy and herbal hop bitterness. Some apple fruitiness in the taste along with hints of prunes and other dark fruits. Mouthfeel: medium body with enough carbonation to impart some tongue tingle. Semi-dryO: A bit different and relatively complex for style, as if there is a touch of Belgian influence.{some revision with new bottle on April 2013)\n",

S : A sweet and malty aroma with a bit of that fruity sweet scent attributed to these styles. A very slight smoke and berry. Not really any hop aroma. T : starts sweet and light, then has that berry like malt flavor. The middle has a bit of musty and earthy hops that are strictly flavoring. finishes with a caramel and smoke flavor and sharp hop that is ever so slight but cuts the flavor to clean M : medium carb and and a clean finishA pretty nice beer. Better than what I expected. Flavorful and clean, easy to drink and at a good price as well.The bottle says a product of the US. Brewed in Rochester NY although the website says UK. Still a very enjoyable beer.\n",

The aroma is sweet caramel and reminds me of Newcastle Brown Ale with a bit more punch. The body is in the medium range with a smooth creaminess on the tongue. The taste is a strange marriage of sweet sugar and pepper tart. It ended dry.\n",

      "text: I found a bunch of these single 12oz brown bottles in a discontinued bin at the Foremost Liquor store in Glendale Heights, IL. 2 for a dollar was such a deal that I took all they had. Interesting to find out that this beer has only a 3.8% abv for their UK market, but cranked up to 4.2% for the American market. The bottles I have are all the 4.2% variety.The beer poured a crystal clear dark amber color that made a 2Â½-finger tan head. Head retention was OK and lacing was decent.I love the smell of this beer. Buttered biscuit aroma with some caramel sweetness underneath. Grassy English hops round out the smell.Nice blending of flavors. Biscuity malt, caramel, toffee, and butter flavors meld nicely with the earthy hops. Not really that bitter for an English bitter, but I liked it nonetheless.Light to medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation.I don't know what the actual price of these would be when found on the shelf as opposed to the discount bin, but I would recommend trying some if you can find then. A good session beer with the non noticeable alcohol level.\n",

      "text: Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #40 (May 2010): Two fingers of head leave an impressive lacing on the glass as its clear copper color shines in the light. Its biscuity and buttery aroma carries with a side of earthy hops. With the crisp, dry, malty body, smoothness wears well on this beer. With dry maltiness throughout, mineral or perhaps a hint of salt comes in as soon as the hop bitterness stings the palate. Herbal, woody, earthy hop flavor does very well against the dry biscuity maltiness. Tart apple skin, nougat and tea leaves come to mind. Buttery, fruity yeast keeps to a minimum but does lend enough flavor and complexity to give this ale an edge over many.Wow, what a treat!! This is clearly a great pick if in need of a solid session ale. Great job on this one.\n",

      "text: Picked this up at Luke's in Rockland, MAPoured in to a pint glassConsumed 6/15A: This beer pours a murky, dark copper color with a one finger of khaki colored head. Head recedes to a creamy film that retains throughout and leaves streaks of creamy lacing on the glass.S: Nose is rich in caramel malts with some grassy hops also present. Nose is rather muted though. T: Taste starts with a sweet caramel malts presence. Middle has some oddly blended toasted malts and a bit of a citrusy hop. Finish is all grassy hops. M: Light body, high carbonation, somewhat prickly on the back of the tongue, very thin almost watery body to it. D: This is an ok beer, a bit thin, some odd blended flavoring. It is certainly sessionable ABV wise, but there are better representations of the style out there.\n",

      "text: Poured from 12oz bottle. Review from notes.A- Pours a nice amber color. One and a half finger light tan head dies down fast. Left light lacing on the sides of the glass. Nothing special with this beer....kind of bleh looking actually.S- The aroma proved to be a little better than the apperance. Light roasted bittersweet malts clash with some light caramel malts. More earthy than floral hops in the middle to ending aroma. This wasn't too powerful in the nose but you could pick up these scents without burying your nose in the glass.T- Light toasted malts in the front end of this right off the bat. Caramel malts follow into the middle with some light citrus flavor. Earthy hops on the backend of this beer doesn't really shine at all and falls short of the aroma. M- Light mouthfeel. Carbonation is high for the style I think. Goes with the beer sadly though. Light roasted malts left on the palate with some hop lingering in the aftertaste. Light drying on the palate and somewhat clean tasting. D- This is a drinkable beer and high at that. This has to do with the fact that there isn't a high flavor in this. Good drinker for someone who is just starting into craft beer. Also, good for someone who wants to drink import but not something from BMC.\n",

Ample carbonation.D: Even though this beer is bit mundane, it's still very drinkable. At 4.2% ABV (according to the bottle), these go down very easy. i could easily put down more than one at a time.\n",

I note from the label that it says &quot;brewed in the EU for Strangford Lough&quot;.Poured a red amber brew with a slight haze. Head shrank to a thin head, but remained on the body for the duration. No lacing.Very little to stimulate the sense of smell; slight hops. The taste was a dull hop taste, with a freshness saving the brew making it a decent enough thirst quencher. Could be drank as a session beer (low alcohol) and nothing offensive, but could get a bit boring. Reasonable.\n",

I feel somewhat insulted by this. CaffreyÂ’s has a slightly offensive, sugary taste that makes it difficult to drink compared to other ales. It is however quite well-balanced.

Flavour contains a cidery apple/pear along with sweet, almost bready malt. A bit of hops come out on the finish, but are slight.

The final appearance is nice with a deep amber hue complimenting the thick and creamy head. Unfortunately the taste and smell does not match the appearance; the smell is stale and the taste somewhat hard to define, but definitely leaving a sense of sourness. No hops are noted in the brew at all. The mouthfeel is creamy yet bland in its residual palate sense. Watery liquor taste. Not a pleasing taste to be sure; won't go back.\n",

It leaves a nice thick head which lasts until the end (Which is usually quick!)The taste is a nice mixture of bitterness and flavour.When living in England my place was near an O'Niels Pub, which soon became my local watering hole. It was there that I was introduced to Caffrey's Ale, which soon became my beer of choice. I am kind if biased, but this is one of my favorite beers. It was this beer that introduced me to the wonderful world and awseome variety's of beer that is available to us. I owe my eye opening to this beer!\n",

Went back to the same place 2 weeks later simply to have another and was told it is no longer made. What's up?! I loved this beer. Wonderful aroma, exceptional taste, sweet (if you like that thing) with a delightful flavor all it's own. Slightly red or coppery color, would this be considered an Irish red ale? Are there any others similar?\n",

Everytime I go to the local Irish Pub, I start off with this beaut. It's easy on the tastebuds and get's ya ready for the night. The head is always a nice thick cream color and it's real thick too. The seperation it does in the beginning is just like Guinness, which is another great beer in my book. Anyways, the finish is nice a sturdy, but light at the same time. It's not stouty or bitter, which I think is the reason it makes a great &quot;starting out&quot; beer.\n",

Hint of fruity esters, floral hop and diacetyl with a thin caramel malt aroma. At first the mouth feel is smooth and creamy but further down the pint it seems and carbonation is non-existent and gains a watery texture. Body feels a bit thin, malt flavour is in the form of a steel caramel malt and lightly kilned graininess. Hops bring an ample bitterness with a trailing leafy flavour.This ends up to be a beer that needs to be consumed quickly.

No freshness date.Appearance: Pours a lively, waving, cascading brew -- awesome to watch. When it settles the liquor is amber with light red hues and the head is a solid finger's width of creamy white foam that sticks all over the inside of the glass. Head stays all the way to the bottom of the glass.Smell: Floral sweetness with a dry, raw coarseness about it.Taste: Incredibly smooth, creamy and full. There's a near dextrin malt sweetness that is full of herbal and floral flavours that are rather tasty. Hops get mildly coarse and raw on the palate, then the brew dries up for a brief moment with a slight lemon/salt-like hop bitterness. The palate is soon quenched with the smoothness of more light sweet malts that hold a faint toasted flavour and background (way back) grape fruitiness. Aftertaste is unusually neutral when still chilled, dry and coarse when warmed.Notes: I don't care what anyone says, Caffrey's is a fine beverage and so easy to put down that it often scares me. A Friday lunchtime favourite for my buddy Dee and I. We always have 2 or 10.\n",

      "text: Can: a big green 440mL can, and yet somehow it still comes across as a classy number. Minimalist but well designed.Appearance: super creamy pour - very white to start but slowly changes to a clear amber colour. Medium thick white head that leaves some lace as it ever so slowly drops. Looks good!Aroma: what aroma? Not much there at all. I know it's a mid strength, but one would expect a bit more than just a light toffee malt on the nose. Disappointing after the pour.Taste: follows the nose, I'm afraid. It does have those trademark red ale characteristics of earthy hops, toffee-caramel malts and a touch of some barley, but it is simply far too weak for my liking.Aftertaste: not much here either - disappears from the palate too quickly for an expensive red ale.Mouth feel: mouth feel is light to moderate in body with a lower carbonation. Slightly smooth, but not as creamy as the full-strength versions.Overall: the best way to describe this beer is with but one word: boring. If it was in fact a premium 5%+ beer it would probably be alright. The right flavours are there, they are just way too muted. Add to that a price tag over AU$75 for an equivalent case of 24 x 330mL, and you've gotta be joking.\n",

      "text: Caffrey's Irish Ale, the &quot;white Guinness&quot; as I used to call it, used to have 4.8% ABV as well, and much like Guinness it is slowly working its way down to mid-strength. It's sad to see brewers do this to their beers and I can only see a drop in flavour is to better serve the masses of people that don't drink beer and never will regardless of the flavour whereas the avid beer drinkers (such as myself) are losing out. Anyway let's see how badly the flavour has suffered since the last time I had it it was 4.8% ABV.Poured from a 440ml nitro-can into a nonic pint.A: Nitro beers always look fantastic and the Caffrey's is no exception with it's deep copper body and perfect 1cm creamy white head.S: Toasted barley malts are foremost on the nose, with a hint of brewers yeast, some light earthy hops [read: very light earthy hops] and the effervescence of spring water. T: Boring as tap water. I know that this beer used to have a flavour profile but really now it just tastes watered down. Yes it has barley malt, yeast, hops and water, but they can at least make it interesting God-dammit. It does have a slight dry toasted barley after taste, which is just as well because you wouldn't know it was a beer otherwise.M: Mid to light body, flat carbonation, texture of water with a small amount of beer added.D: This is a very typical Irish ale, like Kikenny, et al... I have difficulty distinguishing between these beers after years of drinking full flavoured pale ales. Well the verdict is: this used to be a decent Irish pub beer but has suffered at the hands of corporate-greed/marketing-to-teenagers and as a result it is now tap water that contains alcohol: disappointing.Food match: I would have previously said &quot;Irish pub fare, stews and shepherds pie&quot; but now (at the new flavourless 3.8% ABV version) I say plain crackers with cream cheese for dipping... also make sure that cream cheese doesn't have any added flavourings.\n",

      "text: 32oz growler, from the very newish Wine and Beyond (read: Liquor Depot meets Costco presentation esthetic) booze superstore in deepest south Edmonton. I used to drink this stuff like water on tap back in the day after university obligations were fulfilled, at least for the day, in those natty nineties.This beer pours a clear, medium golden amber hue, with two fingers of creamy, foamy off-white head, which leaves some sparse, broad swaths of bubbly lace around the glass as it slowly seeps away.It smells of sweet, sugary, grainy malt, with a touch of treacle, caramel, a mild orchard fruitiness, and very, very soft leafy hops. The taste is weak grainy, bready malt, a slight toastiness, faint yeast, muddled, plain drupe fruit esters, and muffled noble hops.The carbonation is very laid back, sleepy, and yet not flat-seeming, the body a less than solid medium weight, and of course, pretty damned smooth, in just that eerie Irish ale manner. It finishes off-dry, the lingering underwhelming bready malt really suffering nothing in the way of challenge.Not the grandest of rip-snortingly pungent flavours going on here, I suppose, but perhaps this isn't the venue for such a thing - the Irish, and we willing tourists and diaspora, if I recall correctly, use this type of watery sideshow as a respected moderator for their Whiskey habit. I sure could go for some of the latter, as a matter of fact.\n",

It doesn't taste like an Irish red at all. Of course, it doesn't advertise itself as one either. It self identifies as a &quot;smooth Irish Ale.&quot; Mildly hopped water with a hint of grain is how I would describe this. Maybe it tasted better before Molson Coors bought it. Who knows. But this doesn't really taste much like beer. It's lack of carbonation makes its thinness even more noticeable.

The head lasted for around 5 minutes before it began to dissipate. Smell - malts, tea, pears, butterscotchTaste &amp; Mouth - The beer has a low amount of carbonation and it feels very creamy on the tongue. Most of the taste consists of malts, butterscotch, and a pear/fruit sweetness. There was also a bit of a metallic flavour and it reminded me of an iced tea to some extent. It finishes with a smooth malty/tea aftertaste.Overall - A nice easy drinking beer that is ideal for a session. It is along the same lines as a Kilkenny Irish cream ale. I could drink a few of these every now and then.\n",

A finger of nitro-assisted white head is there and doesn't dissipate at all. Some very mild lacing. Some floral hops with a lot of caramel in the smell. Flavour actually has more bitterness than I remember, some sweetness as well. Creamy mouthfeel from the nitro. This is an ok beer, nothing special though.\n",

I didn't get much in the way of aroma but the toffee and malt flavour was really enjoyable. Carbonation is low and very fine. The problem with this is quaffability. I can smash down a whole pint before I can even taste it so drinkability is huge. There's not a whole lot going on in terms of complexity and it is a bit watery but this suits me as long as the flavour is there and though the toffee and caramel is subdued it's still there and balanced. Good but not great.\n",

S: Light sweet malts, biscuits and hint of green apple. Nothing else comes though.T: Again like smell, sweet roasted malts and some biscuity to it. Nothing to strong, very pale and bland. M: Medium bodied and light carbonation. Smooth and creamy while leaving a dry lightly malty finish. D: This reminded me of a darker Boddigton's ale. No flavours are strong in this, very bland and pale. I wouldn't buy this again - maybe it's the style it self, but it's a weak beer.\n",

Popping the can released a satisfying woosh and pouring revealed a creamy beer with a lovely head. The appearance suggested this would be a wonderfully smooth drink.The first thing that I noticed upon taking a sip was how flat the beer is. There is absolutley no carbonation, maybe due to the nirto-can approach. The taste was equally flat and dull. In fact, I could barely discern any taste whatsoever.More sips revealed nothing intereting whatsoever. It's the most unrewarding beer I've ever sampled. I bought a 12 pack for Â£8, making each can only 66p. So I've no probelms in giving the rest away or pouring it down the sink. A complete waste of drinking time.\n",

The nitro-widget brings an impressive mousse-like head taht laces very will. A nice cask-condition look.Aromas, ...well there are none. As the beer warms, faint scents of pilsner malt and graininess begin to emmit. Maybe a floral, spicy hop but boy is this streatching it. The beer really has no meaningful aroma.Flavors are ...well even more obscure than the aroma. The beer has a thin malt-grain flavor mixed with a looot of water. Hop flavor is extremely low and helps just a touch. Maybe a fresh baked bread or dough taste? I've had mineral water with this much taste.Mouthfeel, you guessed it, very watery with only a very light reminescent of malt. Bitterness is also extremely low. The creamy carbonation bailed ship long ago and hardly contributes to and creaminess or roundness. It must be tough to make a beer this bland and flavorless. The good news is that there are no bad tastes, but pleasant flavors are also MIA. This is one bland and watery beer.\n",

The mouthfeel was thick, and creamy, with very light carbonation. When taking into account the lack of carbonation, the flavour was nothing more than malted water. One could easily drink 5-6 of these as they go down easy...on this day, one was enough for me.\n",

      "text: On nitro-tap at The Mask Bar, in the Strand Plaza Hotel in London.Nothing in the United States like this beer, Wexford does not even come close.Pour is awesome, very dark copper/amber, with a thick and ultimate creamy head that lasts.Incredible flavor, rich and full of sweet malts and cream. One of the smoothest beers out there.Absolutely try it if you can, not sure if this is available in the US anymore. Perhaps a trip back to London soon.Cheers!\n",

      "text: Pours a deep reddish-copper with the nitro bubbles reaching the whole way to the bottom before they precipitate out and leave behind a very tight white head that is about a finger high. The head stays down to the bottom of the glass and leaves good lacing; classic nitro, except for the odd whistling farty noise when I opened the can. Smell is faint, with floral hops and some caramel as well. Taste is caramel and roasted malts, with a slight hop finish. The mouthfeel is pretty thin and watery, and flat as well, but not terribly so. It just lacks the usual creaminess that is the upside of the trade off between appearance/mouthfeel and taste/smell. The drinkability is very good though.\n",

It has a faint malty smell and a toastiness comes through in the taste. I thought it hit the palate a little bland but finished stronger. The body was creamy, and I know that's the style, but I can't help but think it was still a little flat.If this was my local brew, I wouldn't turn it down.

I don't see how the appearance can be improved upon.The aroma is a tad weak and I picked up a faint tin-like scent from the can.The taste is also a bit on the weak side. Initially pleasant, the flavour quickly loses its grip and becomes a battle between a a slight sweetness and a strong bitterness. The latter side wins.Creamy and pleasant on the palate, Caffrey's Irish Ale is not bad but is , unfortunately, in my mind, rather disappointing.\n",

For the life of me, I can't smell a damn thing from this beer. Had to smell some food to make sure my nose was actually working. Not sure what to make of that. The taste doesn't really taste like much, sorta like the guinness nitro cans, except not near as sweet. It's slightly bitter, and a very very faint toffee flavor, but not much else at all. Mouthfeel is great, it's really creamy, again, it could almost pass for real cream. I probably won't be getting this again.

The aroma is quite muted, but there's some caramel maltiness, a hint of fruit, and some floral hops. The mild flavour is matched by low bitterness. Caramel malt and light fruit start things off, with hops kicking in towards the finish. Low carbonation (of course) with a light body and a dry texture, especially as it warms. This is a great session beer, especially on nitro-tap... not very complex, but tasty enough to have several.\n",

      "text: Poured a promising amber with a luxurious nitro head... The reverse cascade of bubbles gives away the nitro-charged deliver system. It leaves a thick, dense creamy head that lasts the entire brew.The smell was all fruit and malt with a mild bready note. No real hops to speak of in the nose.The taste is full bodied and creamy smooth. There's quite a bit of fruit in this amber ale, lots of peach, plum and raisin sweetness along with a sweet bready note. After weeks of West Coast hops this ale seems almost hop-free but in reality it's got a subtle showing of fuggles or golding to add a small amount of balance.Despite the thick, long lasting head the mouthfeel was disappointing. The brew itself was essentially flat but covered with a fluffy nitro head. There was no carbonation (nitrogenation?) to provide effervescence to clean the palate and with a pretty weak hopping there just wasn't much of a finish to each sip.This is a very tasty beer and certainly a nice low ABV session beer. It's got all the good characteristics of an ale from the British Isles with the typical hearty amber ale fruitiness. A bit more hops and it would have been a part of the regular rotation.\n",

Came out a deep dark clear burgundy under a one finger tan head that was very creamy and full of body. This head lingered literally to the bottom of the glass (with 1/4 centimeter of liquid left, there was still 1/2 centimeter of foam!). Beautiful sheets of lace completed the visual experience. The nose was way too mild, however, to the point of being almost imperceptible. The mouth was heavily carbonated, and heavy bodied. The taste was about right - roasted malt, almonds, plums and cherries. The finish had some hops, but not enough for my taste. The aftertaste was roasty, with a touch of bitterness. A solid product, but nothing spectacular after the great optics.\n",

      "text: Appearance â€“ Good dark amber colour, even towards the russet end of the scale. This beer has a small baby finger head that leaves mild lacing with good evidence of carbonation.Smell â€“ Good malty aroma with hints of citrus. There is also some sweetness from the honey but no notes of the ginger in the nose.Taste â€“ Again like the nose good malt flavours to begin with a little sour hops at the back of the tongue. This is followed by a spicy hint of ginger but this is extremely mild. The honey in the brew combines with the hops to give a burnt toffee like front while the finish is sour citrus.Mouthfeel â€“ Medium body with good linger and nice coating of the throat.Overall â€“ This one is very drinkable. It is mild and easy while still retaining good flavour. This is still available in Northern Ireland (as of September 2014) and I have contacted the brewery to enquire about its status. If it is not retired I will certainly be getting some again.\n",

      "text: On Tapp.Appearance â€“ Deep amber towards red even with a finger high white head of large bubbles. The head dies quickly to think lacing within 2-4 minutes.Smell â€“ Smells of Armagh apples and bakery, almost like an apple tart. Slight hint of earthy hops and sweet caramel.Taste â€“ Pretty much follows the smell. Definite apple fruitiness, earthy hops so there is almost a woody/nutty flavour riding through it. Good sweet biscuit and caramel flavour so it is all nicely balanced and a riot of flavour Mouthfeel â€“ Thin in the mouth owing to its smaller head, good carbonation for the style. Dry and a slight astringency from the sour apples nip at the back end.Overall â€“ A cracking beer. The fresh ingredients from the kingdom of Mourne make this a very fresh feeling drink. Good for a night out, I must confess to having more than a few on the first time I tried this it is a very good example of the style and certainly a good ambassador for Northern Irish craft brewing.\n",

Here is not a balanced flavour profile, but the bitterness level is surprisingly high to make this seeming malty Best Bitter taste more like a lower gravity, assertively bitter Bitter!M&amp;D: light-ish bodied, moderately flavoured, more-ish and dry-ish coz of the palate, overall the hops lend a vivid impact on the hop-malt balance and lift up the overall weight quite smartly. I suspect the fresh draught version could only be better and more hoppy.\n",

      "text: Clear, reddish brown with a finger sized and slightly off-white head that settles to a thick lacing after approximately a minute.Light bitter notes and a earthy malt base along with some caramel and nut. The finish is a slightly sweet, slightly bitter one.Basic bitter taste with some mild spices and a touch of earthy hops and malts coming through. There isn't a whole lot going on in this one but I can taste some very mild fruits and a touch of sweetness.Light medium with a slightly watery feel in parts and about medium carbonation. There is some bitterness in the finish which is also a dry one.A basic pale ale or bitter style beer that although solid is pretty unexciting. Not one to rush out and buy but possibly worth a try since it is one of the better Northern Irish beers out there, although choice is fairly limited.\n",

      "text: The first time I had this was at The Crown Bar in Belfast. It s from cask , and I was extremely impressed at how fresh and hoppy it tasted. The head was at least three fingers high. It was a great example of local beer done right, I have to say. I decided to try it from a 500l ml bottle. Slightly differentPoured into Heineken pint glass. Two finger head. Pleasant chestnut color. Head remains for a while and lacing persists all the way down. Smells biscuity, slightly hoppy, fresh. I can't wait to have a swig of this.Taste is different from cask. NO hops but I expected that as most cask brewers from what I ve been told, throw a huge wad of fresh leaf hops in before tapping a cask. Fresh, bready, sweet caramel finish. I could drink a good few of these.Has a medium body, what one would expect from a session beer. Carbonation matches the style perfectly. Nuff saidOverall, different out of the bottle but still pleasant to drink. I was surprised by the caramel finish. I will definitely pick up a few more of these the next time I come across this fine beer. Now I m not saying that this is a great beer, but my enthusiasm for this example comes from the fact that it is a local Northern Irish brewery staying true to what they know how to do.\n",

They only started bottled less than a month ago as far as I know after speaking with the brewer, so lets see how its translated to bottlePours with a lighter body than the cask version, rich coppery with amber hues. Tight off white head with good retention, some small patches of lacing down the glass. This isnt bottle conditioned sadly and is filtered so no signs of hazeSmell, carmelly malt, some dried fruits, spiced figs, brown sugar, fresh wort, a few esters and very slight alcohol on the noseTaste, sweet and crisp, chewy and biscuity malt, nice smooth lasting bitterness on the finish. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, maybe a little overly carbonated like alot of english ales when they are bottled but leave it a few mins if you want a more cask-like mouthfeelNot as good as the cask version but still very good, very drinkable as usual and good to be able to access this at home\n",

Earthy hops with chocolate and espresso coffee smell.Taste â€“ Really good roasted flavours from the barley and malts and these are well balanced by the smoothness imparted by the oats. It has a nice bitter edge but it is not over powering. The coffee flavours are really very mild in this one but there is strong dark chocolate flavour.Mouthfeel â€“ Metalic and a little thin but it has good linger and is towards the dry end of the scale.Overall â€“ A good solid stout with balanced flavour. This beer is not overly strong on any front but it is confident and well balanced. It does lack the creaminess of Guinness Draught and the bold flavour of Guinness Extra but it has great chocolate notes and is quite like Brains Original Stout.\n",

Thanks to my son-in-law for bringing this back from Belfast for me.Very black (I wonder how they chose the beers name?), with a good and lasting tanned head.Bitter chocolate nose and taste, with treacle hints adding some sweetness in the mouth. I found this both interesting and tasty.Good body depth, if a little too bitter at times as ground coffee beans added their slant onto the already bitter chocolate flavours I'd already en-counted.\n",

There is some lacing on the glass and retention is good but the head was just far too big, even with a delicate pour.Roasted malts with some lighter coffee notes and some mild chocolate too. There isn't too much other than that.Roasted malts taste with lots of coffee and a slightly milky flavour. I could also detect some chocolate with a touch of spice.Very strong carbonation and very dry too with a bittersweet feel and a medium body.Pretty ordinary and unexciting with just the usual stout like flavours and nothing extra thrown in. The carbonation was also too high which didn't help matters and it wasn't a beer that I particularly enjoyed.\n",

      "text: BB Oct. 2013, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass.A: pours a deeply dark brown colour, topped with a well-lasting frothy tan head, carbonation level unknown.S: rich and semi-oily roasted malts with obvious sweet cocoa/coffee notes, a swirl brings out the toffee-ish aroma, toasted nuts and lesser black dates. An intriguing touch of rust also wakes up to each swirl. Overall, richer in aroma than I had imagined for this beer style.T: dry and bitter from the beginning, besides the full flavour and rounded aroma of roasted barley and black malts, charred nuts and even crushed coffee beans, there goes a subtle dark-fruits like acidity and a flow of earthy/herbal/nutty bitterness to caress the wings of the tongue, leaving behind a long, aromatic, lightly chewy-spicy bitter aftertaste, as a vivid reminder of both the depth of roasted malts and the hop elements.M&amp;D: clean on the palate, although in the long finish a chewy feel doesnâ€™t go unnoticed, this moderately-carbonated, medium-bodied, smooth dry stout lives up to the standard and expectation, that itâ€™s dry, sufficiently bitter, at the same time retaining a solid body without tasting thin like many other stouts. Iâ€™d really love to try its cask-conditioned version, which I think would be just sublime and definitely a favourite session stout!\n",

Tightly-bubbled tan head that hangs around forever, with a lot of cling.S - Roasted malts take the lead, with some bitter, coffee notes and a little dark chocolate.T - Similar to the aromas, roasty malts open with a touch of sweetness, which quickly gives away to an espresso-like bitterness that finishes with that lingering hop bitterness. As it warms, the bitterness backs off a bit, leaving a more rounded and balanced experience of sweet and bitter.M - Medium body, light carbonation, smooth with a lingering bitter finish.O - Overall, a very nice example of an Irish stout, and nice to have a couple of as a session beer, or to sit and enjoy on its own.\n",

A: Pours a dark black with a two finger head of nice cream, a bit tan, with brilliant retention. Sm: Roast, coffee, malt, toffee. Beautiful. T: Roast, coffee, toffee, cream on the finish. Balanced but light for the style. Mf: Too silky and smooth for the style, which demands coarseness and dryness. The flavours would be stronger if they lingered.Dr: At 3.30 pound, better brews can be had. Fans of the style will enjoy it, but be warned: it an't Guinness.\n",
