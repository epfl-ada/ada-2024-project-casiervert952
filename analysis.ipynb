      "text: This was a 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.It pours a dark brown with some clarity but not truly transparent. It has a frothy head with mild retention and low lacing. By far the best thing this beer has going for it is a truly amazing malty aroma that does not dissapoint. If only the taste delivered the same punch. It has a mild malt taste and is followed by a metallic finish. This could be due to being Ina bottle so I would try again on draft but it did let me down. The body is kind of weak with decent carbonation. I would buy again if the price was right but it didn't strike me as awesome.\n",

      "text: Six pack from George's deli case, always some oddball beer in there. Brewed in Rochester, NY, per the label. &quot;1060&quot; Julian date on the neck of the bottle.Pours quietly into a tulip glass, a murky chestnut brown that glints copper orange when held to the light. A finger of light tan foam rises up, it has a creamy surface texture, but doesn't remain long. Spotty froth around the edges of the glass. Sweet buttered biscuit aroma, and more than a little touch of skunky euro hops lending some grassiness.Toasted grains and specialty malt flavors, nutty and sweet. Fairly soft feel with a slight creamy texture, not bad. Flavors are a little faded and a touch bland, but that could be due to age. Medium dextrinous body, some astringency, light carb that seems to ebb away towards the end of the glass.Overall not bad, a couple bottles paired well with charcuterie from the deli.\n",

Aromas are super-sweet, with a blending of toffee, butterscotch, and bitters. Flavors are tangy sweet, with a caramel backbone and an overall roasted character. Fairly light bodied, with a slight watery feel underneath the initial bold flavor profile. The aftertaste is mostly roasted, with the sweet blend of toffee and butterscotch lingering around a bit. Tangy, slick finish, with a bit of a filmy linger left behind. Not a bad beed, and very easy to drink.\n",

A touch of earthy hops and hints of baked bisquits. Aroma and taste match, except for the bitter-sweet dimension, with the taste being more balanced at first, and mildly bitter in the finish. More alcohol than there should be in the aroma after warming. T- Initially sweet and then an unsweetened caramel taste finished with a little bit of hop bittersM- medium body; good, medium-light carbonation. Slight dryness.

It smelled of caramel and a slight hoppiness. The mouthfeel was thin in body with low carbonation. The taste had hop bitterness up-front that transited to a light, clean watery flavor, with a biscuity aftertaste. The light body, moderate ABV, and refreshing feel make this a very drinkable beer with high &quot;poundability.&quot;\n",

Pretty good head retention.Smell is extremely malt-heavy and slightly sweet. Not bad, but pretty one dimensional. Nothing really stands out or jumps at you here.More of the same in the taste. Very malty with a little bit of hop-bite. It's a little sweet, and there's something almost a bit metallic in the finish.Pretty thin body and mouthfeel. Carbonation tends to fizz on the tongue a bit.I could drink several if I wasn't the one paying for them. I'd take this over a Yuengling, there's a bit more in the way of hops going on when you compare the two.Morey's Bottom Line: I've seen this a lot around town. This bottle was given to me by a friend, and honestly, it's better than i anticipated. I don't think I'd pay for it unless I was super low on cash. It's pretty cheap at less than $5 a sixer!\n",

      "text: Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #40 (May 2010): Mashed in Ireland and fermented in the US ... interesting concept.This brew is clear and tawny with enough head retention to last the session. Butter, toffee, herbal woody hops, toasted bread and a vague fruitiness make for a very aromatic nose. Its fluffy, moderate-size body comes off as a bit wet. The maltiness is dry and goes from toffee to toasted bread crust quickly. Buttery flavors and hop bitterness battle it out as the maltiness settles in as a decent base. Suggestions of apple skin, ripe pears and nut- tiness are in the middle. The buttery character lingers and its maltiness holds together in the dry finish.Good drinking for the Ã¼ber beer geek who does not mind a bit of diacetyl (which is responsible for that buttery flavor).\n",

      "text: Poured from 12oz bottle. A- Pours a brown sludge looking color. One finger light white head that shows light retention. This comes to leave light spotty lacing around the glass with each sip.S- Light caramel malts dominate this beer from start to finish. A light hop in the backing doesn't really balance this beer out after trying. Overall sweetness in the aroma kind of kills any expectations for a pale ale. T- Caramel malts come into play first like I thought they would. This gives way to a light toasted flavor that still for some reason has a sweet taste mixing or following very closely in the middle. A light bitter hop strikes for a second before being overtaken by a sweet caramel malt. M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is low for the style but oddly fits the beer well. Sweet malts dominate everything from the palate to the sweet aftertaste. Off balanced for a pale with sweet malts helping that unbalance. Light alcohol drying on the palate. Flavors were dull and at times felt heavy on the palate.D- It has a low ABV which means I should be able to drink a good amount of it...but I do not care for this beer at all.\n",

      "text: This beer is a bit of an amalgam of several styles. It has the color of a Brown Ale, and the taste is somewhat of a combination of an EPA and an Irish Red.Pours chestnut brown with a moderate head that retains well and leaves significant lacing behind.Nose is malty and buttery.Flavor has an EPA-like fruitiness with the slightly dry finish of an Irish Red. Malty throughout with hints of butterscotch and molasses. Halfway through my second one there was even a light whiskey-like booziness, which was strange from a brew under 5%.Medium to full body with even carbonation; a touch prickly.Not bad; pretty solid, but I'm not sure about the drinkablility. It might get a bit old after 3 or 4, but I rarely drink that many anyway.\n",

      "text: Legbiter poured a dark brown with ruby red highlights. The clarity was excellent, as well as the head. It faded slowly leaving a wall of foam around the edges. The nose was hop heavy up front, but the intensity faded after the initial waft. What remained was a somewhat tinny variety of noble hops, citrus, with a dash of ripened fruit and diacetyl. The first thing evident in the flavor was the buttery character. It was warming, and definitely sharp. Sweet caramel and toffee, wheat bread, and dark sugars made up a deep sweet taste. The feel was very creamy with mild carbonation. The last bit went down foamy, and the finish was filmy and mouthwatering. Bold and sweet, this one is a good sipper. The nose leaves some to be desired, otherwise a very good beer.\n",

Head is off-white, bubbly and relatively persistent, reaching a few millimeters high and retaining a nice hearty millimeter of foam, fat tidemarks around the edge.Odor: Toasted white bread with hints of toffee and red fruit over a backdrop of minerally almost steely aromas. Not picking up much in the way of hops, but that's ok.Consistency: Deceivingly big, medium bodied with a full, rich, malty feel. Carbonation rides low to medium providing a creamy feel.Flavor: Yeast fruitiness is in full effect, providing a back-end to big toasted malt and pale malt sweetness, hints of tobacco. Not much in the way of hop character, suggestions of earthiness, low low low bitterness, barely balancing. Nutty yeast and toasted malt pair in the finish. This feels like it might be categorized incorrectly. It feels like an English brown with some Scottish ale characteristics.No matter what you call it, it is an extremely flavorful beer, especially considering the ABV. Unfortunately, the flavors lean sweet, I feel like this beer would be much better if there was a bit more in the way of bitterness, for balances sake.\n",

      "text: spotted this in the nick of time before making the mistake of ordering a $4 rail mixer. Glad I found it.This beer really confused me at first, because I was expecting a light colored ale. Only when I looked at the style on this site did it make any sense.Poured a semi-translucent brown, head disappeared quickly, but again, a plastic cup didn't do any favors there.Smell was what really threw me off. I had no idea what I was getting into. It smelled like the opposite of an APA -- that is to say that Legbiter was slightly heavier on malt than the hops. Taste was much the same, with an earthen malt flavor, backed up by a disappointingly low amount of bitterness. Hop presence was still there, but more would've been excellent. In my mind, this doesn't quite stack up to SNPA in terms of flavor, but it's definitely the more easy going of the two. More of a session beer in my opinion due to the slightly relaxed flavor.\n",

      "text: This bottled brew shows a clear mahogany color with a decent off-white head and lacing to match. The aroma offers just a hint of citrus hop and toffee sort of sweetness. The flavor jumps out with more hops but blended very nicely with the toffee-caramel sweetness that results in a very pleasant red ale sort of idea. Very drinkable but offering a reasonable dry hop sense, a smooth feel with a medium body, fair carbonation. Just a very pleasant beer overall and more substantial than anticipated. Definitely in the Irish family of Killians only with a more legitimate hop element and better constitution. Recommended for a try if you like this style at all, and generally a brew that should offend few.\n",

Smell faintly like raisins. Taste was pretty mediocre. Had a strange metallic tang to it, just like other ales like Smithwick's. I find that very unappealing.

Hints of cotton candy (any sugar added?) and finally the sweetness mellows and taste is somewhat toffee like. Nice, creamy, real ale body, good carbonation for the style.

      "text: From a Brew only a few years old, of Northern Ireland, 2004. I brought this beer into my Store, Wines Unlimited, where I am the beer manager. Strangford Lough was just recently introduced into the USA, first through CT and RI. The Import owner, Michael Bean owns the rights to both states. Strangford is soon to release in 20 states. Michael Bean, president of the Import Franchise here in CT, brought me some samples, which I liked. The Legbiter, and the St. Patrick's Best. He is hosting a Tasting in our store on March 12th (Friday) 2010, 5pm to 9pm.As for this Beer, the Legbiter:Very refreshing, smooth, medium bodied. Good taste. Pours a nice amber color, with decent head, good retention and a bouquet of aromas are present. The aromas are very fruity, citrus, lavender, floral, some grassy notes, and honey. The taste is strong on the hops, notes of spicy fruits, sweet &amp; salty notes, apples... and some subtle citrus. This is a good beer, and a really good surprise from an Ireland Micro brew, I highly recommend this beer. Not as main stream as Guinness, but can compete with the market if marketed well.Cheers, for good beer.\n",

      "text: 500 ml dark brown bottle. Freshness date on side of label.Note: This beer displayed some over-exuberance upon being released from its captive bottle. A slow, steady bubbly foam arose for about 20 seconds; when we decided to slooowly pour it into pint glasses before we lost any more goodness.It poured a coppery golden color with a nice, thick off-white head with lots of sticky and trailing lace.A full fruity smell is noticed before the pour is complete. Apples come to mind. Light citrus notes, a slight flowery bouquet and grassy malty aromas follow. The aroma lasts and lasts.The flavor however doesn't quite live up to the expectations created by that promising aroma. The fruity taste is quite subdued. A citrusy bitterness mingles with a tart, slightly astringent black tea bite. A mildly bitter lemon rind sourness and an edgy yeasty, cidery taste emerge. A biscuity malt is too far in the background.I had this on cask at NERAX a few years back, and thought I had already rated this beer by that serving type, but I guess I never entered it into BA. However, I do remember it being far mellower and smoothly balanced than this bottled version. All in all, it's a very gulpable brew. Quite refreshing! CypressBob came through...BIG TIME! More unique Irish Ale reviews are coming! Thanks John!\n",

Small, Irisih hop burps ensue. This is like a west coast pale ale pumped up with goldings instead of cascades....Nice. Mouthfeel is creamy and cask-like in it's real ale qualities and the drinkability is very good. Is this stuff bottle conditioned? Wow, almost like a great SNPA clone made in Northern Ireland.

This transitions to flavors of earthy yeast and herbal hops, the latter of which contributes a light amount of bitterness.M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate to high amount of carbonation, making it seem a little airy.

      "text: Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, this beer is beautiful. A vibrant, crisp, blood-ruby coloring with a slight ring of filmy, off-white head around the edge of the surface. Aromas of toffee richness and a tangy sweetness blend together for a subtle nose. Flavors are bitter forward and all over the tongue, with a subtle, rich toffee backbone that peaks its head around the corner every once in a while to keep things on an even keel. The richness almost has a syrupy quality to its flavor. A light bodied beer, this feels heavier with the richness of the flavors, but somewhat sharp with the carbonation and bitterness. A bittersweet aftertaste, with some roastiness to it. The beer has an almost smokey, light, and crisp finish. Tasty brew.\n",

Body color is a deep reddish brown color similar to an Irish ale, with nice chestnut hues on the glass.Nice chewy and dense malt on this, a little grassy. Hints of winter warmer like cinnamon, and dry spices.Taste is a bit missing. Faint grassy malt, with a slightly wet body. There's really nothing going on here I wish I could say something. Extremely light even for a bitter, but has a very crisp almost hot aftertaste, where most of the flavor seems to be.Overall, interesting, but not particularly memorable.

Pours a clear, dark red-brown with a small but lasting beige head. Limited patchy lacing.With the head intact, the aroma seemed far more like a cider than reasonable. As the head dissipated, the aroma remained fruity but less specifically apple and also more floral and malty. A tad earthy with hints of toffee, smoke and herbs. Sweet malt became most prominent with warming. Taste: a nice mix of sweet caramel and toffee malt with spicy and herbal hop bitterness. Some apple fruitiness in the taste along with hints of prunes and other dark fruits. Mouthfeel: medium body with enough carbonation to impart some tongue tingle. Semi-dryO: A bit different and relatively complex for style, as if there is a touch of Belgian influence.{some revision with new bottle on April 2013)\n",

Interesting to find out that this beer has only a 3.8% abv for their UK market, but cranked up to 4.2% for the American market. The bottles I have are all the 4.2% variety.The beer poured a crystal clear dark amber color that made a 2Â½-finger tan head. Head retention was OK and lacing was decent.I love the smell of this beer. Buttered biscuit aroma with some caramel sweetness underneath. Grassy English hops round out the smell.Nice blending of flavors. Biscuity malt, caramel, toffee, and butter flavors meld nicely with the earthy hops. Not really that bitter for an English bitter, but I liked it nonetheless.Light to medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation.I don't know what the actual price of these would be when found on the shelf as opposed to the discount bin, but I would recommend trying some if you can find then. A good session beer with the non noticeable alcohol level.\n",

Sip of water. Lightly estery. Earthy, tea-like herbal hops with sufficient bitterness. Hint of grains. Drying, malty finish.Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium-plus carbonation provides some slight tingle.Overall: Simple, thin, easy-drinking stuff if that's what you're into these days.\n",

The aroma is of bread, citrus, caramel sweetness, mild bitterness, and some other smell I was unable to place. Taste is also of citrus, bread, mild bitterness, and caramael, but even chocolate made a slight appearance. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and St. Patrick's Best Ale finishes semi-dry, easy drinking, and delicious. This is a very smooth and drinkable brew, and I highley recommend giving it a chance.RJT\n",

      "text: Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #40 (May 2010): Two fingers of head leave an impressive lacing on the glass as its clear copper color shines in the light. Its biscuity and buttery aroma carries with a side of earthy hops. With the crisp, dry, malty body, smoothness wears well on this beer. With dry maltiness throughout, mineral or perhaps a hint of salt comes in as soon as the hop bitterness stings the palate. Herbal, woody, earthy hop flavor does very well against the dry biscuity maltiness. Tart apple skin, nougat and tea leaves come to mind. Buttery, fruity yeast keeps to a minimum but does lend enough flavor and complexity to give this ale an edge over many.Wow, what a treat!! This is clearly a great pick if in need of a solid session ale. Great job on this one.\n",

T: The taste starts out bready with a hearty malt character followed by mildly sweet flavors of caramel, honey &amp; nuts.

Nose is rather muted though. T: Taste starts with a sweet caramel malts presence. Middle has some oddly blended toasted malts and a bit of a citrusy hop. Finish is all grassy hops. M: Light body, high carbonation, somewhat prickly on the back of the tongue, very thin almost watery body to it. D: This is an ok beer, a bit thin, some odd blended flavoring.

      "text: Poured from 12oz bottle. Review from notes.A- Pours a nice amber color. One and a half finger light tan head dies down fast. Left light lacing on the sides of the glass. Nothing special with this beer....kind of bleh looking actually.S- The aroma proved to be a little better than the apperance. Light roasted bittersweet malts clash with some light caramel malts. More earthy than floral hops in the middle to ending aroma. This wasn't too powerful in the nose but you could pick up these scents without burying your nose in the glass.T- Light toasted malts in the front end of this right off the bat. Caramel malts follow into the middle with some light citrus flavor. Earthy hops on the backend of this beer doesn't really shine at all and falls short of the aroma. M- Light mouthfeel. Carbonation is high for the style I think. Goes with the beer sadly though. Light roasted malts left on the palate with some hop lingering in the aftertaste. Light drying on the palate and somewhat clean tasting. D- This is a drinkable beer and high at that. This has to do with the fact that there isn't a high flavor in this. Good drinker for someone who is just starting into craft beer. Also, good for someone who wants to drink import but not something from BMC.\n",

But since this beer is classified as just a bitter and not an ESB I need to rethink my perception of what this beer should be. It has hops but not to the extreme. It has flavor, good aroma, and tastes good. I am happy to have drunk my first bitter.St Patrick Rules!\n",

The oranges were perhaps overdone on the nose but this was a minor complaint, the rest of the beer more than covered this and it was a lot better than I was expecting.\n",

      "text: Appearance - Extremely dark with thick beige head of tight bubbles. The head retention is really good and it leaves a medium amount of lacing.Smell - The first blast is slightly sweet with a tiny bitter edge. This develops to hints of herb and leaves such as coriander with a nice biscuit and licorice overtone.Taste - Sweet taste of coke, bitter coffee and dark bitter malts  balanced with good herb flavour such as mint and coriander.Mouthfeel - This has good head so it feels pretty full in the mouth. Decent boozy feel with a slight metallic edge but not heavy at all.Overall - This is an excellent porter. Well balanced with great flavour and depth but not overly heavy. I really think this beer will stand the test of time and become known as a good session porter. Its mix of herb, sweet and bitter make it something special and I personally rate it as one of the best brews I have ever had.\n",

Smell - Straight on the nose you get some caramel sweetness with a malty background &amp; some subtle hops. Taste - Initially follows the nose. There is a sweetened caramel malted body with a slight bitter end. As the bottle went down further the mouth feels had a natural warmth which helped give it fuller flavour. Mouthfeel - A little thin for my preference with a slight sharpness that leaves a coating, some boozy warmth but noting to strong. Overall - Quite a smooth beer but not particularly exciting though it is far from the worst beer in the style I have come across, light body and not enough hops flavour for personal preference.

      "text: 500ml bottle bought from The Vintage, AntrimPoured a nice golden yellow colour with a slight haze. Off white head poured big thick and foamy. Tons of carbonation rushes to the surface maintaining a thick rocky covering throughout... lots of sticky lacing...Aroma - Juicy and maybe slightly tropical fruits (pineapple, lemons, limes, grapefruits), light pine, light palm sugar / caramel sweetness, sea salt, light toasted malt, some hints of rubber, fresh cut wet grass, light herbal notes, talcum powder, quite floral, white pepper...Taste - Nice juicy floral hop bitterness perfectly balanced by some light caramel maltiness, light floral honey sweetness, good fruitiness (oranges, grapefruit, light pineapple, apricot), herbal notes, quite perfumed, faint soapy hints...M&amp;D - Smooth and creamy with a little sharpness underneath. Light / medium bodied... supremely quaffable..Overall - An excellent IPA and one of the best beers brewed in Northern Ireland i've had... highly recommended...\n",

At 5.5% and 47 IBUs, this risks being in between APA and IPA, but it feels like the former except maybe in body, which is thin for all the flavour. Great bang for your ABV, though it gets harsh: loses the aroma but not the bitterness and goes toasty as it warms. Why aren't more people talking about Northbound? 4\n",

      "text: Ruby brown with puffy taupe foam that fades. 3.5Raspberry tartness and phenolic Band-Aid nose - no hops or coffee, not promising. 3A bit of brownie, ash, earth, vinegar, lots of smoke, no real hops. 3Grape skin + Angostura end and tannic linger. Crisp, round, mostly light. 3.75Plastic! Some of those phenols are from the smoked malt, Iâ€™m sure, but they bury the hops, any supposed coffee, and just about everything else. This is not banging fresh, but considering this may just be poorly executed, that doesnâ€™t excuse what has no signs of ever having been a CDA. Pokertree continue to have QC issues.

Weirdly still the bottle says &quot;brewed with oak smoked wheat&quot;  They give tasting notes as smoke, pine, herb and I never got much of either of these but they didn't list the other hop notes which are very prominent.  I wonder if the sloppiness in the label information carries through and they bottled the wrong beer?\n",

Note: 52 IBUs, using US, NZ and UK hops.A: pours a bright and clear amber colour, coming with a fluffy but well-lasting off-white frothy head and abundant feed of carbonation.S: burned sugar, raisins, orangey fruitiness and a touch a cream/butter, featuring quite sweet and syrupy malt sweetness upfront with a lightly salty tail.T: like a premium bitter, the entry has lots of ripe dark plums and dried berries like raisins on a balance with rich flavours as of lightly toasted teas and biscuity malts, followed closely by an expanding wave of spicy, earthy and mildly tannic hop bitterness which concludes each sip with a decent level of bitterness but also a rounded mouthfeel, never too harsh on the part of hop tannins. The delicate edge of Cascade/Fuggles-like hop aroma seems to linger amidst the malt aroma and spicy bitterness.M&amp;O: the mouthfeel remains pretty decent, full of tiny carbonation to be enjoyed on the palate without going too fizzy, which goes well enough against a medium body and a moderate flavour profile. The sweet, burned sugary notes on the nose donâ€™t seem to render much on the palate. All in all, a decent Best Bitter with easy drinkability.\n",

The aroma has a definite caramel and butterscotch quality to it with some earthy hops to balance it all out. It does have a sort of cellared feel to it too.The body is medium and on the creamy side.The taste is more sweet and malty than bitter although the mild bitterness does creep in on the backside.\n",

It doesn't blow me away, but it's not bad.Taste: very malt-centric; toasty and a little bit biscuity. Actually, the biscuit kind of grows on the palate; not my favorite. Hop character is nil, but there is a bit of bitterness at the end. Not my favorite, but there is something here if you don't mind biscuity malt.Mouthfeel: medium body with a big carbonation and a pretty nice creaminess, especially for the style.

Earthy tones to this.M: Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Sessionable beer here that you could drink all night.Overall not a bad beer that is worth another try fresher.

Significant amounts of lacing are observed.S: Light to moderate aromas of slightly fruity malts and earthy yeast with slightly stronger aromas of herbal and floral hops.T: Upfront there are moderate flavors of cereal grain and biscuit malts with a light amount of light fruit/stone fruit sweetness. That is followed by moderate flavors of earthy yeast and stronger flavors of herbal hops. Light to moderate amounts of bitterness are present but fade fairly quickly.

Smells creamy, like mashmallows and vanilla custard with hints of coffee creamer and berries. Flavor is somewhat similar, but milder. There is an initial impression of sweet cream and marzipan, with the flavor building to notes of black tea and toffee and eventually chocolate on the finish. It has a balanced and persistent bitterness that keeps this beer from ever coming off sweet. Smooth creamy mouthfeel, like a Boddington's pub can, gives me the impression of a milk chocolate truffle.\n",

      "text: A: The beer is relatively clear light amber in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a finger and a half high off white head that gradually died down, leaving a quarter finger high puffy head covering the surface and lots of thick lacing down the sides of the glass.S: Light to moderate aromas of earthy and fruity yeast in addition to floral and herbal hops are present in the nose.T: The taste very much follows the smell but also has hints of underlying biscuit and cracker malts. It's not very bitter, but the bitterness stands out and particularly lingers through the finish given the lighter-bodied nature of this beer.M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and somewhat crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.O: This beer was rather easy to drink and quite flavorful for the style. I would definitely consider getting this again if I was looking for a good representation of an English Bitter.\n",

      "text: Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a half finger slightly off-white head that dissipates slowly to a thin film and ring around the glass. Aroma dominated by caramel, almost toffee malt, very light dark fruit, slightly buttery. Flavor follows with biscuit and caramel malt and mild dark fruit, finishing with pleasant low-key slightly earthy bittering hops. Like other Celt Experience ales, the earthiness seems close to peat, which fits with the malt very nicely. This brewery's ales are, as a group, some of the best and most satisfying low ABV ales I've ever tasted. Well done.\n",

Pours copper in color, hazy with a thin and irregular white head that soon settles to an irregular ring. The aroma is full of caramel/toffee, with a background of dry grains and biscuits and a hint of fruity esters. Surprisingly exotic. The flavor is a little more mundane, with the malts coming to the fore, and enough hops to mostly tame the sweetness as well as adding a nice spicy note in the finish. Some herbal, fruity, chocolate and nutty notes Medium-light-body with a moderate amount of carbonation and a touch of dryness in the finish. O: A distinctive and flavorful beer well worth checking out.\n",

      "text: New Welsh brewer I haven't seen before. Picked up at the Beer Dispensary in Apex for under five bucks for a sweet half liter bottle. Pours an unfiltered copper color with a thin cap and a thick coating of lace. Nose is funky with yeast and noble hops predominating. Definitely an organic, earthy scent. The first sip is a bit disappointing. Plenty of hop bitterness, but the malt is either off or nonexistent and the balance needs work. Surprisingly high level of carbonation throws me off a little as well. I suspect this would be better on tap or better on cask. Improves as it warms with more sweet malt balance and is a pretty decent example of the style. I will give these guys' other offerings a good, hard look.\n",

      "text: 500ml bottle, attractively capped and sealed, with a BB of Feb 2013. Welsh beer for Rabbie Burns' turn on the social calendar? Why the hell not - I seem to remember the disparate Celts all being good neighbors.This beer pours a clear medium golden amber (ok, 'bronze') colour, with two fingers of puffy, pillowy off-white head, which leaves but a single arch of sudsy lace on the lee side of the glass as it all melts away. It smells quite enticing - sharp biscuity, slightly toasted malts, dark sweet raisin, mild toffee, and wet leafy, earthy hops. The taste carries through on the promise with more bready, biscuity, grainy, malt, a bit of tobacco, mild orchard fruit, some latent caramel sweetness, and pleasantly musty, earthen cellar-like hops.The carbonation is rather more than sedate, with a wee, understated zippiness; the body a subtle medium weight, and agreeably smooth. It finishes with a notable crisp, fruity flourish, the malt, fruit, and zingy hops still charmingly intermingled.Siiiiggggh. What a lovely bitter - big (but not too much so - if that's even a thing) flavour, well rounded, and genuinely capable of coaxing you into that next swig before you may have otherwise considered.\n",

Taste consists of dry caramel malt with unrefined grainy notes which are not really pleasant. Body is about average with good carbonation. No interesting ester or light dry hops presence or even some interesting malt profile to distinguish this beer; no brewing flaws either but not something I would wish to revisit again.\n",

      "text: Bottle from the LCBO, 500ml into a pint glass. Best before December 2012 (12/12?).POurs a clear golden orange with a nice cap of offwhite head. Some semi-dense, creamy head and some nice lacing. Nose has some nice English hopping, gentle breadiness, some cracker and general sweetness. Taste has more prominent hop flavour, slightly earthy and a touch spicy, leaving some moderate bitterness behind on the palate. Gentle breads and English malt sweetness as well, with some fruity notes too. Mouthfeel is medium light, moderate carbonation and and fairly long bitter finish. Drinkability is certainly high, and this is something I could certainly revisit for the style. Quite a simple beer, nice for what it is.\n",

      "text: Although dedicated to the Bronze Age Celts, it's highly unlikely any of them would ever have seen a beer anything near this clear (or even this light in colour, for that matter). The body, whose colour damn well delivers on the beer's name, has a luminescence bright enough to burn. Its glossy clarity only adds to its chic luster. While I'll happily buy every other quality about this beer, I'm selling the aroma. It is a peculiar scent. It has enough hearty grain and raisin to suggest full maltiness, which is good, but it also has a dank earthiness that smells something like wet leaves. It resembles a particularly musty and buttery biÃ¨re de garde. It raises an eyebrow. The malts are lush with a caramel sweetness. A rustic, honey and oat loaf breadiness ensues from the sip but is blunted by candied, almost grapefruit-y hops. I prolong swallowing in hopes that the flavour will last longer. But then a delicious note of melon rind sets in and I almost want to take my next sip solely for the aftertaste. The beer has the same wholesome qualities as a country-baked multi-grain loaf. Bubbles are restrained, allowing gooey malt sweetness and honeydew-like melon flavour to linger. Both, however, turn to grain sooner or later. The beer is so refreshing that it starts to strike me as even lower in alcohol than the posted 4.5%. My second Celt Experience was again a good one. This tiny Welsh brewery seems to make very hearty, gratifying ales out of very ordinary recipes. We can only imagine what beer was like in the Bronze Age, but if it was anything like this offering it's no wonder it became such a staple in the Celtic diet and such a popular tipple worldwide.\n",

Smell contains some caramel/butterscotch malt, some earthy hops, and a pronounced toasted malt scent. Taste is similar to smell. The toasted malt flavour is most prominent, fairly bready. Some mild hop bitterness is present as well, and lingers at the end. Caramel flavours are there, but less so than in the nose.Fairly carbonated, light bodied ale. Goes down easily, but with flavour. Overall, a pleasant but not exciting beer. Would be a good session beer, and nice on a hot day. Flavourful but not strong.\n",

A fair amount of visible carbonation.Fairly mild, but pleasant aroma. Caramel maltiness with a subtle chocolate tone. Fresh grains, raisins, flowers and a soapy quality can also be found. Nice taste. Caramel and chocolate malts are joined by an assertive hoppy bitterness that lingers throughout the finish and a subtle buttery note with a tinge of grapefruit and pepper.Light to medium-bodied with a high carbonation level. Definite yeasty, bread-like quality on the tongue. Dry aftertaste with an earthy quality to it.Very drinkable and well-balanced session-style ale with a surprisingly robust taste and North American-style hop profile.

There is also a bit of a dark fruit flavour and some fruit esters. The beer finishes with a malty dry hop bitter aftertaste.Overall â€“ Not bad at all.. There is actually a surprising amount of taste and hop bitterness going on with this beer. Not something that I'd rush out to buy a stock pile of, but if you're a fan of EIPA's or ESB's you'll enjoy this one.\n",

Little to no head, although quite lively.Aroma, earthy, but sharp, sourdough bread like.Decidedly different, and quite sharp, tangy flavour with little malt, or firm body. Very upfront. Mouthfeel dry, sharp, leaving an acid film/coating.Not my personal favourite, by any means. However completely different to expectations. I get the feeling it was either too old, or too young.

      "text: Received in a beer52 order; I don't usually partake in saisons so this shall be a new experience for everyone.Pours hazy terracotta into a tulip glass from a 330ml bottle. The offwhite head, initially 2 fingers high, dissapates instantly to nothing after a few moments, leaving zero lacing.The nose is tart strawberry - slightly artificial - loganberry, some tutti frutti, funky yeast, and just a hint of grain underneath it all. It smells sweet, slightly perfumed, and acidic with a definate earthiness.For me the taste follows the nose with tart strawberry, dried raspberry, tangy funk, and acidic perfume. I'm not familiar with what constitutes a good farmhouse ale but I'll plough on. There is a dominant dried berry character, quite sweet, crisp, and tart with a sour earthy palate that sits beneath it all. In the finish it presents with some dank hop, vinous sours, and mild cereal but the strawberry holds it all together.This ale is light-medium bodied, zingy, and slightly oily in the mouth. The carbonation gives a little tang on the sip that complements the 6% ABV.I usually avoid saisons like the plague but the more I get through this one, the more and more I like it. I'm still not a huge fan of the style but I can get behind this ale - even if it does smell a bit like cheap lip gloss.\n",

      "text: The colour is brass (15 EBC), the liquid is clear. The two finger head is yellow-beige. It sinks slowly leaving some lacing. The smell is mild. Some pale ale malt, dried flowers and earthy hints. The taste is â€¦ it feels a bit tired. Medium bitter notes gets somewhat sharp after a while, perhaps even a bit sour. Some semi-sweet malts. Again, tired somewhat tired dusty flavours. Medium body. The aftertaste is bitter with some alcohol and some dried fruits. The finish got lemon-like bitter flavours. And a touch of leather. The carbonation is medium to strong, the mid-size bubbles somewhat sharp. The liquid is mid-smooth. I donâ€™t know, there is something old and frowsy about this beer. The best before date: 1st December 2013, so this shouldnâ€™t be a problem.\n",

S: Rich smell of hay and nettles hits the nose at first, but not only floral hops is strong - the bitter ones are obvious as well. Some caramell malt lures in the back, semi-sweet. Buttery. T: Bitter hops galore... But the floral hops are in better balance compared to the smell; the hay and nettles is followed by red berries and some apples. The caramell malt is overpowered by the awesome hoppyness. M: Aftertaste is very long and lovely bitter. Body is a bit buttery and rather thick, while carbonation is held back.O: Well, as an English Pale Ale - I'm not sure... WAY to much hops. But I kind of love this one anyways; not the best EPA, but a pretty darn interesting and nice beer, though...\n",

      "text: [Suggested Glassware: Nonic Pint]The pour was a lightly cloudy medium chestnut brown with an average (1-2 fingers) off white frothy head that reduced down to a puddled film and large collar with good sticky spotty lacing.The aroma was moderately malty with a biscuit malt, light floral hops and a sweet doughy yeast along with notes of caramel, citrus (orange and tangerine) and a mild fruity ester (raisons and figs).The taste was good and malty with a moderate caramel sweetness which was present throughout, and then progressed with a bit of fruitiness along with a mild hop presence and a good bitter citrus peel ending. The flavor lasted an average time proceeding the swallow, with a sweet bitter citrusy taste lingering on the taste buds for a bit longer.Mouthfeel was a few steps above light in body with a watery yet dry texture and a very soft carbonation.Overall I really enjoyed drinking this brew, it possessed just the right balance of sweet malts and bitter hops...http://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews\n",

      "text: Poured from 500mL bottle into a pint glass.Appearance: medium orange-brown hue with a moderate haze and a relatively strong effervescence. Head is a finger of frothy tan foam. Pretty attractive.Smell: lightly spiced aroma; sweet malt with notes of orange, vanilla, and something floral -- chamomile, perhaps. Earthy and calming.Taste: earthy, bready, toasty malt, with more of that floral character. There's something here which is smoky; almost like a lapsang souchong tea; I kind of like that aspect. An interesting brew.Mouthfeel: medium body with a decently creamy feel. Not bad.Overall: this is kind of a bizarre beer, but I like its dank, earthy, smoky feel.\n",

Good clarity.The aroma has a weak caramel malt note, doughy esters, some spices, and maybe just a little vanilla.The body is medium with a slight astringency. It breaks into carbonation bubbles on my tongue.The caramel malts are a little more evident in the taste as is the low to moderate bitterness that quickly vanishes at the finish. Easy drinking.

Aroma of dark and caramel malt (hints of malt syrup), nuts and sweet toffee. Interesting flavor of biscuit and caramel malt, nuts, hints of light fruit and great, light peat that really sets this light ale apart. Finishes with light peat, bittering hops and residual dark malt. Light to medium bodied. I really liked the deep malt body and the peaty element blended nicely with the hops to give this a more interesting, rustic taste. I enjoyed this quite a bit and unlike many otherwise satisfactory light British ales, I will seek this out again. A pleasant surprise.\n",

Persistent sheets and strands of lacing noted.Smell: Solely hops. Strong herbal and some sulfur smells. Taste: Bitter up front, bit of buttery/biscuity malt in the middle, and bitter finish. Bitterness is classic English bittering hops.Mouthfeel: Lively carbonation, slick. Overall / Drinkability: I would classify this better as an English Bitter than an English Pale Ale. That being said, it's above average and quite hoppy. Went well with a ploughman's lunch, but too expensive to get again. Worth a try though.\n",

      "text: 500ml Bottle from the LCBO Ottawa for 3.50$Appearance - Clear copper colour with a small size fizzy off-white coloured head. There is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is some good lacing. The head lasted for only a minute or two.Smell - Malts, caramel, grapefruit, hops, faint chocolateTaste &amp; Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste caramel, grassy hops, and some faint grapefruit. There is also a touch of toffee/chocolate. It ends with a malty sweet aftertaste with a decent amount of hop bitterness.Overall - I was surprised by the amount of hop bitterness. I can appreciate the great flavour this beer has, especially considering the low ABV. Worth trying.\n",

      "text: The label calls this a &quot;mid brown ale&quot;(sic) and, indeed, its colour is basically that, mid-way between brown and golden (the result being a tawny-amber tone). Its radiance is not bright enough to blind the beer's clarity. Although loose-headed the surface has not a bare spot on it and more and more the same can be said of the glass. The aroma carries a floral, herbal kind of pungency that only English hops could deliver. It is earthy and bitter, showcasing very little fruit but plenty of spice and herbalness. It would be tremendously pleasant if not for being so terribly bitter (which, mind you, I personally find very appealing, though the average person might not). The leafy, herbal, spicy bitterness of the hops carries over onto the palate where flavors of hibiscus, fennel, carnation and fresh cut grass dry out the mouth and leave an almost minty aftertaste that becomes lost in stale bread crusts and crumbs of biscuits. Like all the other ales I've had from Celt, this is full and persistent, conventional yet special. Floral and herbal hops are as natural a pairing for English pale ales as pepperoni is for pizza. Yet, when it comes to convincing British brewers to use them, it's like trying to teach cats to bark. Fortunately the fine people at Celt understand this and use the little green buds in good quantity, contributing ample spice and rose-like refreshment. Native Storm, like all the Celt offerings, is an encouraging testimony to the state of beer in Great Britain. While some UK breweries have limited themselves to traditional customs, and others have used hype to subsidize creative but superficial and sub-standard offerings, Celt strikes a positive and effective balance between new and old world. I expect lots more good things to come from this tiny Welsh brewery.\n",

      "text: Picked up this 500 ml bottle the LCBO from a hidden corner. Poured into a Duvel tulip. Nice thick foamy head. Good retention settling into a nice lace. Beautiful mahogany colour with larger bubbles rising to the surface at first giving way to a streams of small bubbles. Initial smell is of some light hops, a sweet bisquit and a touch of apple.Entry on the palette is smooth with light carbonation up front but quickly settling in at the back of throat. Some taste of spice and malts but the real presence of the beer is the hoppy finish which lingers and lingers. Not strong but actually very well balanced which makes a very refreshing and enjoyable beverage.It's not a complex beer but that's ok. Overall a pleasing experience. Native Storm is a beer that works very well on its own or paired with your favourite food.\n",

      "text: Single bottle from the LCBO. Name is in reference to Owain Glyndwr (Owen Glendower), who led a Welsh revolt against English rule in 1400 which lasted for 15 years, though he himself disappeared in 1412, never to be seen again. Poured into a nonic. Dark amber, with a creamy, almost nitro head of foam. Lots of lacing, great retention. Solid looking brew.Nose is sweet fruit (apple and berry), flowers, a touch of hops and biscuit. The description of the brew on the bottle is the somewhat oxymoronic &quot;robust mild brown ale,&quot; but I agree this resembles more of a well-hopped English pale. Nice biscuit and fruit entry, a bit of spice, and a long dry hop finish that is accompanied by a touch of grain. Creamy mouthfeel, low carbonation - again, this feels like a brew from a nitro-can. Solid brew, would have again - I agree, this would be nice on cask.\n",

      "text: Bottle from the LCBO, 500ml into a tulip. Best before end of January 2013. Described on the bottle and website as a 'robust mid-brown ale,' so hopefully the English Brown Ale style categorization suits this somewhat. Auburn in colour, fairly clear with some eggshell coloured head. Sticky webbed lacing and bubbly retention. Bready and biscuity on the nose, some hopping. Maybe a bit of fruitiness and some caramel. More hops on the palate, earthier and spicier with some pronounced bitterness. Dark bready maltiness again, with a dry finish. Medium light feel and similar carbonation, easy to drink and not too complex. Simple, and consumable in quantities. I'm sure this would be nice on cask.\n",

      "text: 330ml bottle poured into a tulip glassLook: When I poured this, I was immediately reminded of draught Guinness - opaque black, albeit with ruby highlights when held up to the light, a tight, off-white head and that wonderful two-phase look as the main body of the beer and the head mix. Good head retention.Smell: I didn't get a great deal in the smell, but what was there reminded me of a chocolate/espresso stout. That is to say, dark roasted coffee, cocoa powder and chocolate plus the usual dark roasted malt and burnt sugar smells you generally get from a stout. Slightly smoky.Taste: Deep and dark - the coffee and chocolate flavours really shine through here, along with dark malts and plums/raisins. Doesn't quite have the bitter edge of a 'true' coffee stout, but the coffee flavours are undeniably there. Give it a chance to warm up a little and it really does come to life. Quite exquisite, and ticks all the boxes for me.Feel: As others have pointed out, it's a wee bit chalky on the finish but the flavour profile more than makes up for that. For a double-figure ABV it's not what you'd call excessively heavy. There's a good balance of roasted malts, smoke and coffee with a long, dry finish. A bit light compared to some Imperials, but none the worse for that.Overall: If this was truly a limited run then it's a real shame as it's not only a mighty fine Imperial stout but a mighty fine beer in general. If you like stouts and you happen to find a bottle of this, you'd be foolish to pass it up - very good indeed.\n",

Given a good swirl, the sweet edge of burned caramel comes to the surface, otherwise the aroma is predominantly citric hoppy with a faint suggestion of black cherries, raisins, and leather.T: in line with the aroma, the foretaste comes extremely light-bodied in terms of maltiness and roastiness, rather slick on the palate, and rather acidic citric fruity in terms of hoppiness, backed by faintly bitter-chocolaty notes, random roastiness, longan-fruits on shells, and the unsweet edge of plum preserve; as the warming alc. deepens, the sweet edge of dark malts also lingers, until all are outlived by the herbal and mildly spicy flow of hop bitterness and aromatic roasted malt undertones, always with prune-ish smoked acidic notes on the side.M&amp;O: softly-carbonated, the body remains fairly light as far as an Imperial Stout is concerned. The flavour balance unusually, heavily tilts towards the hop department, but all in all the weight of malts still anchors quietly at the back in order to help carry through the hop theme. A very different, but highly tasty and well-crafted, Imperial Stout this is.\n",

      "text: 330ml bottle. A rather Native American-seeeming inscription/scratching on the label, which upon further investigation is actually Gallic language, wherein trees have a lot of influence. Anyway.This beer pours a pretty solid black hole, except for those broad cola highlights, brightening up the edges, and two fingers of densely puffy, silkily foamy beige head, which leaves some hefty, awkwardly splattered, and honeycombed lace around the glass as things slip away.It smells of lightly roasted chocolate, grainy caramel malt, a light orchard fruitiness, and a leafy, earthy hoppiness. The taste is gritty, grainy cocoa-heavy malt, a bit of of semi-sweet coffee liqueur, a sort quite reminiscent of Kahlua, for what it's worth, what with all that indistinct cafe au lait, and generic java shop 'joie de vivre'. Oh, and the craftily sublimated booze - can't quite forget that now, can we? In the interim, there is a wee bit of earthy, leafy hops, some quite overwhelmed caramel malt, if we're still interested in the base beer.The bubbles are actually a whole whit more perceptible that I was anticipating for the style, the body full in weight, so, quit asking questions, yo? Oh, right, it finishes well off-dry, the cocoa, caramelized malt, and edgy, yet still ill-defined hops ruling the day.A nicely introductory version of the style, the cocoa, and grainy malt - all in hepped-up proportions, natch, having more influence than one might otherwise prefer. That's because the other players here just don't have the chutzpah to compete. Sad, but true, but who the hell cares - this is one hefty, chocolatey, boozy (without any sort of actual agency), imperial stout. Good stuff, my Celtic bros!\n",

No vanilla in the taste. A pretty classic RIS taste, dominated by alcohol though not in an overly harsh way. With the czech hops it seems mostly 'hot'. Other than that, bitter burnt malts with a creamy texture. Overall an okay attempt. Perhaps a lower abv or some more aging would tone down that heat.\n",

      "text: 330ml bottle poured into a Troubadour tulip glassLook: Deep, golden yellow with a couple of fingers-worth of snow white, bubbly head. Decent retention and leaves behind a small amount of lacing on the sides of the glass. Let the head dissipate and you're left with a uniform, white foam cap. A little bit of sediment, but far from excessive.Smell: Smells very much like a 'traditional' tripel - slightly grassy, plenty of yeast, citrus peel and more than a hint of spice (think coriander, plus a slight pepperiness). The bottle mentions cinnamon, although to be honest I didn't detect an awful lot of that. Even so, if a good, 'full' smelling beer.Taste: Tastes like a traditional tripel, too, although the presence of cinnamon is actually evident now. This reminds me of an overclocked witbier - plenty of candy sugar, coriander and orange peel with a lingering, hoppy bitterness.Feel: Slightly syrupy but not overbearingly so - the fruit and spice flavours are well to the fore and there's a nice, bitter finish where you get a hint of the American hops.Overall: Another one-off brew from Celt, which is rather sad in a way since despite being from Wales rather than Belgium this is a mighty fine 'exotic' tripel. Definitely reminds me of a witbier turned up to eleven, and despite being 8.5% ABV it doesn't feel like it. This, and Ogham Ash, are a pair of absolute crackers which are well worth tracking down. A credit to the style, with a nice twist.\n",

      "text: 330ml bottle, produced with orange peel and cinnamon. Apparently there's more to an oak tree than I had previously imagined.This beer pours a slightly hazy, pale golden yellow hue, with a rising tower of glistening, creamy, foamy white head, which leaves a loose patchwork of fuzzy, sudsy lace around the glass as it it slowly sinks away.It smells of sharp, edgy green yeast, sassy black and white pepper, pale grainy malt, dry orange rind, and a further bit of musty, earthy hops. The taste is more spicy, green and black pepper, semi-sweet, rich pale grainy malt, a touch of caramel, a hint of metallic cinnamon, some sozzled fleshy orange, and more edgy, leafy hops.The bubbles are present, and a bit peppy, but nothing more, the body medium-light in weight, and smooth, but with a simmering alcohol caveat. It finishes off-dry, the sugary pale malt and fleshy orange having a challenge on hand with the lingering spice, pepper, and hops.A tasty flavoured tripel - the adjuncts doing well to distract from the usual alcohol astringency. Not much is discernible from the cinnamon, unfortunately, but I'm sure its contribution is part of the overall sublimation into the total flavour vortex. Good stuff, and I don't usually throw those words around lightly for this style.\n",

      "text: 330ml bottle, lots of florid descriptive text on the label concerning the Ogham language, and their spiritual interpretation of a willow tree.This beer pours a clear, crisp bronzed amber hue, with three fingers of bulbous, frothy, loosely foamy dirty white head, which leaves some stringy cloud lace around the glass as it evenly subsides. Rather attractive, this one is.It smells of bready, lightly pastry-like caramel malt, orange and grapefruit cream, and perfumed floral, leafy hops. The taste is big and malty - caramel, toffee, sweet bread, a hint of treacle - with some very fruity orange, grapefruit, and pineapple hop notes, ones nearly bereft of bitterness. That comes with the zinginess in the later arriving, and still perfume-dominated leafy, floral hops.The bubbles are soft, and a tad frothy, the body a fairly heavy weight, and agreeably smooth - neither the hops nor the alcohol making any serious ingress here. It finishes on the sweet side, as the malt keeps on its merry way, and those aforementioned tardy hops moving up their schedule a fair bit.An interesting enough DIPA, my first from Wales, so there is that. My only complaint, and reason for the undercutting scores, is the lack of integration between the fruit and the bitter in the hops, and the hiding of the alcohol in that perfume warmth, as clever as it is. Close to the real deal, and one of the better versions of the style I've had from the UK.\n",

By far the best thing this beer has going for it is a truly amazing malty aroma that does not dissapoint. If only the taste delivered the same punch. It has a mild malt taste and is followed by a metallic finish. This could be due to being Ina bottle so I would try again on draft but it did let me down. The body is kind of weak with decent carbonation. I would buy again if the price was right but it didn't strike me as awesome.\n",

Brewed in Rochester, NY, per the label. &quot;1060&quot; Julian date on the neck of the bottle.Pours quietly into a tulip glass, a murky chestnut brown that glints copper orange when held to the light. A finger of light tan foam rises up, it has a creamy surface texture, but doesn't remain long. Spotty froth around the edges of the glass. Sweet buttered biscuit aroma, and more than a little touch of skunky euro hops lending some grassiness.Toasted grains and specialty malt flavors, nutty and sweet. Fairly soft feel with a slight creamy texture, not bad. Flavors are a little faded and a touch bland, but that could be due to age. Medium dextrinous body, some astringency, light carb that seems to ebb away towards the end of the glass.Overall not bad, a couple bottles paired well with charcuterie from the deli.\n",

Fairly light bodied, with a slight watery feel underneath the initial bold flavor profile. The aftertaste is mostly roasted, with the sweet blend of toffee and butterscotch lingering around a bit.

A touch of earthy hops and hints of baked bisquits. Aroma and taste match, except for the bitter-sweet dimension, with the taste being more balanced at first, and mildly bitter in the finish. More alcohol than there should be in the aroma after warming. T- Initially sweet and then an unsweetened caramel taste finished with a little bit of hop bittersM- medium body; good, medium-light carbonation. Slight dryness. O- A fine ale that I enjoyed more than I thought I would. Recommended.\n",

      "text: Poured into a Jail House Brewery tumbler. The appearance was of a deep copper or amber, with a bubbly thick one inch head with good lacing throughout. It smelled of caramel and a slight hoppiness. The mouthfeel was thin in body with low carbonation. The taste had hop bitterness up-front that transited to a light, clean watery flavor, with a biscuity aftertaste. The light body, moderate ABV, and refreshing feel make this a very drinkable beer with high &quot;poundability.&quot;\n",

Pretty good head retention.Smell is extremely malt-heavy and slightly sweet. Not bad, but pretty one dimensional. Nothing really stands out or jumps at you here.More of the same in the taste. Very malty with a little bit of hop-bite. It's a little sweet, and there's something almost a bit metallic in the finish.Pretty thin body and mouthfeel. Carbonation tends to fizz on the tongue a bit.I could drink several if I wasn't the one paying for them. I'd take this over a Yuengling, there's a bit more in the way of hops going on when you compare the two.Morey's Bottom Line: I've seen this a lot around town. This bottle was given to me by a friend, and honestly, it's better than i anticipated. I don't think I'd pay for it unless I was super low on cash. It's pretty cheap at less than $5 a sixer!\n",

      "text: Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #40 (May 2010): Mashed in Ireland and fermented in the US ... interesting concept.This brew is clear and tawny with enough head retention to last the session. Butter, toffee, herbal woody hops, toasted bread and a vague fruitiness make for a very aromatic nose. Its fluffy, moderate-size body comes off as a bit wet. The maltiness is dry and goes from toffee to toasted bread crust quickly. Buttery flavors and hop bitterness battle it out as the maltiness settles in as a decent base. Suggestions of apple skin, ripe pears and nut- tiness are in the middle. The buttery character lingers and its maltiness holds together in the dry finish.Good drinking for the Ã¼ber beer geek who does not mind a bit of diacetyl (which is responsible for that buttery flavor).\n",

This comes to leave light spotty lacing around the glass with each sip.S- Light caramel malts dominate this beer from start to finish. A light hop in the backing doesn't really balance this beer out after trying. Overall sweetness in the aroma kind of kills any expectations for a pale ale. T- Caramel malts come into play first like I thought they would. This gives way to a light toasted flavor that still for some reason has a sweet taste mixing or following very closely in the middle. A light bitter hop strikes for a second before being overtaken by a sweet caramel malt. M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is low for the style but oddly fits the beer well. Sweet malts dominate everything from the palate to the sweet aftertaste. Off balanced for a pale with sweet malts helping that unbalance. Light alcohol drying on the palate. Flavors were dull and at times felt heavy on the palate.D- It has a low ABV which means I should be able to drink a good amount of it...but I do not care for this beer at all.\n",

S: The aroma contains honey, tea, caramelized malts and a touch of hops. T: The taste starts out a little sweet with flavors of honey, tea and a bit of citrus. Then a hearty malt character comes in along with a mild but complementary hops presence creating a decent balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.M: Crisp and a little smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky. D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are definitely several others in the style that I would choose first.\n",

      "text: Legbiter poured a dark brown with ruby red highlights. The clarity was excellent, as well as the head. It faded slowly leaving a wall of foam around the edges. The nose was hop heavy up front, but the intensity faded after the initial waft. What remained was a somewhat tinny variety of noble hops, citrus, with a dash of ripened fruit and diacetyl. The first thing evident in the flavor was the buttery character. It was warming, and definitely sharp. Sweet caramel and toffee, wheat bread, and dark sugars made up a deep sweet taste. The feel was very creamy with mild carbonation. The last bit went down foamy, and the finish was filmy and mouthwatering. Bold and sweet, this one is a good sipper. The nose leaves some to be desired, otherwise a very good beer.\n",

Head is off-white, bubbly and relatively persistent, reaching a few millimeters high and retaining a nice hearty millimeter of foam, fat tidemarks around the edge.Odor: Toasted white bread with hints of toffee and red fruit over a backdrop of minerally almost steely aromas. Not picking up much in the way of hops, but that's ok.Consistency: Deceivingly big, medium bodied with a full, rich, malty feel. Carbonation rides low to medium providing a creamy feel.Flavor: Yeast fruitiness is in full effect, providing a back-end to big toasted malt and pale malt sweetness, hints of tobacco. Not much in the way of hop character, suggestions of earthiness, low low low bitterness, barely balancing. Nutty yeast and toasted malt pair in the finish. This feels like it might be categorized incorrectly. It feels like an English brown with some Scottish ale characteristics.No matter what you call it, it is an extremely flavorful beer, especially considering the ABV. Unfortunately, the flavors lean sweet, I feel like this beer would be much better if there was a bit more in the way of bitterness, for balances sake.\n",

      "text: spotted this in the nick of time before making the mistake of ordering a $4 rail mixer. Glad I found it.This beer really confused me at first, because I was expecting a light colored ale. Only when I looked at the style on this site did it make any sense.Poured a semi-translucent brown, head disappeared quickly, but again, a plastic cup didn't do any favors there.Smell was what really threw me off. I had no idea what I was getting into. It smelled like the opposite of an APA -- that is to say that Legbiter was slightly heavier on malt than the hops. Taste was much the same, with an earthen malt flavor, backed up by a disappointingly low amount of bitterness. Hop presence was still there, but more would've been excellent. In my mind, this doesn't quite stack up to SNPA in terms of flavor, but it's definitely the more easy going of the two. More of a session beer in my opinion due to the slightly relaxed flavor.\n",

      "text: This bottled brew shows a clear mahogany color with a decent off-white head and lacing to match. The aroma offers just a hint of citrus hop and toffee sort of sweetness. The flavor jumps out with more hops but blended very nicely with the toffee-caramel sweetness that results in a very pleasant red ale sort of idea. Very drinkable but offering a reasonable dry hop sense, a smooth feel with a medium body, fair carbonation. Just a very pleasant beer overall and more substantial than anticipated. Definitely in the Irish family of Killians only with a more legitimate hop element and better constitution. Recommended for a try if you like this style at all, and generally a brew that should offend few.\n",

Smell faintly like raisins. Taste was pretty mediocre. Had a strange metallic tang to it, just like other ales like Smithwick's. I find that very unappealing. Mouthfeel was on the watery side and thin. I drank this with lunch, but switched it up to another beer when I finished this one. Nothing special here.\n",

Hints of cotton candy (any sugar added?) and finally the sweetness mellows and taste is somewhat toffee like. Nice, creamy, real ale body, good carbonation for the style.

      "text: From a Brew only a few years old, of Northern Ireland, 2004. I brought this beer into my Store, Wines Unlimited, where I am the beer manager. Strangford Lough was just recently introduced into the USA, first through CT and RI. The Import owner, Michael Bean owns the rights to both states. Strangford is soon to release in 20 states. Michael Bean, president of the Import Franchise here in CT, brought me some samples, which I liked. The Legbiter, and the St. Patrick's Best. He is hosting a Tasting in our store on March 12th (Friday) 2010, 5pm to 9pm.As for this Beer, the Legbiter:Very refreshing, smooth, medium bodied. Good taste. Pours a nice amber color, with decent head, good retention and a bouquet of aromas are present. The aromas are very fruity, citrus, lavender, floral, some grassy notes, and honey. The taste is strong on the hops, notes of spicy fruits, sweet &amp; salty notes, apples... and some subtle citrus. This is a good beer, and a really good surprise from an Ireland Micro brew, I highly recommend this beer. Not as main stream as Guinness, but can compete with the market if marketed well.Cheers, for good beer.\n",

      "text: 500 ml dark brown bottle. Freshness date on side of label.Note: This beer displayed some over-exuberance upon being released from its captive bottle. A slow, steady bubbly foam arose for about 20 seconds; when we decided to slooowly pour it into pint glasses before we lost any more goodness.It poured a coppery golden color with a nice, thick off-white head with lots of sticky and trailing lace.A full fruity smell is noticed before the pour is complete. Apples come to mind. Light citrus notes, a slight flowery bouquet and grassy malty aromas follow. The aroma lasts and lasts.The flavor however doesn't quite live up to the expectations created by that promising aroma. The fruity taste is quite subdued. A citrusy bitterness mingles with a tart, slightly astringent black tea bite. A mildly bitter lemon rind sourness and an edgy yeasty, cidery taste emerge. A biscuity malt is too far in the background.I had this on cask at NERAX a few years back, and thought I had already rated this beer by that serving type, but I guess I never entered it into BA. However, I do remember it being far mellower and smoothly balanced than this bottled version. All in all, it's a very gulpable brew. Quite refreshing! CypressBob came through...BIG TIME! More unique Irish Ale reviews are coming! Thanks John!\n",

It poured with a finger high dense beige head that gradually died down, consistently leaving a thin head covering the surface and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass.S: The smell has light to moderate aromas of toasted malts along with herbal hops and some hints of grassy hops.T: The initial taste has flavors of biscuit and toasted malts along with hints of caramel, toffee and sweetness. This transitions to flavors of earthy yeast and herbal hops, the latter of which contributes a light amount of bitterness.M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate to high amount of carbonation, making it seem a little airy. The earthiness contributes a little dryness towards the finish.O: For a rather light-bodied ale, this beer is packed with lots of flavors. It's extremely easy to drink, which makes this perfectly sessionable.\n",

      "text: Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, this beer is beautiful. A vibrant, crisp, blood-ruby coloring with a slight ring of filmy, off-white head around the edge of the surface. Aromas of toffee richness and a tangy sweetness blend together for a subtle nose. Flavors are bitter forward and all over the tongue, with a subtle, rich toffee backbone that peaks its head around the corner every once in a while to keep things on an even keel. The richness almost has a syrupy quality to its flavor. A light bodied beer, this feels heavier with the richness of the flavors, but somewhat sharp with the carbonation and bitterness. A bittersweet aftertaste, with some roastiness to it. The beer has an almost smokey, light, and crisp finish. Tasty brew.\n",

Hints of winter warmer like cinnamon, and dry spices.Taste is a bit missing. Faint grassy malt, with a slightly wet body. There's really nothing going on here I wish I could say something.

Pours a clear, dark red-brown with a small but lasting beige head. Limited patchy lacing.With the head intact, the aroma seemed far more like a cider than reasonable. As the head dissipated, the aroma remained fruity but less specifically apple and also more floral and malty. A tad earthy with hints of toffee, smoke and herbs. Sweet malt became most prominent with warming. Taste: a nice mix of sweet caramel and toffee malt with spicy and herbal hop bitterness. Some apple fruitiness in the taste along with hints of prunes and other dark fruits. Mouthfeel: medium body with enough carbonation to impart some tongue tingle. Semi-dryO: A bit different and relatively complex for style, as if there is a touch of Belgian influence.{some revision with new bottle on April 2013)\n",

      "text: I found a bunch of these single 12oz brown bottles in a discontinued bin at the Foremost Liquor store in Glendale Heights, IL. 2 for a dollar was such a deal that I took all they had. Interesting to find out that this beer has only a 3.8% abv for their UK market, but cranked up to 4.2% for the American market. The bottles I have are all the 4.2% variety.The beer poured a crystal clear dark amber color that made a 2Â½-finger tan head. Head retention was OK and lacing was decent.I love the smell of this beer. Buttered biscuit aroma with some caramel sweetness underneath. Grassy English hops round out the smell.Nice blending of flavors. Biscuity malt, caramel, toffee, and butter flavors meld nicely with the earthy hops. Not really that bitter for an English bitter, but I liked it nonetheless.Light to medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation.I don't know what the actual price of these would be when found on the shelf as opposed to the discount bin, but I would recommend trying some if you can find then. A good session beer with the non noticeable alcohol level.\n",

Mouthfeel is light to medium, and St. Patrick's Best Ale finishes semi-dry, easy drinking, and delicious. This is a very smooth and drinkable brew, and I highley recommend giving it a chance.RJT\n",

      "text: Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #40 (May 2010): Two fingers of head leave an impressive lacing on the glass as its clear copper color shines in the light. Its biscuity and buttery aroma carries with a side of earthy hops. With the crisp, dry, malty body, smoothness wears well on this beer. With dry maltiness throughout, mineral or perhaps a hint of salt comes in as soon as the hop bitterness stings the palate. Herbal, woody, earthy hop flavor does very well against the dry biscuity maltiness. Tart apple skin, nougat and tea leaves come to mind. Buttery, fruity yeast keeps to a minimum but does lend enough flavor and complexity to give this ale an edge over many.Wow, what a treat!! This is clearly a great pick if in need of a solid session ale. Great job on this one.\n",

T: The taste starts out bready with a hearty malt character followed by mildly sweet flavors of caramel, honey &amp; nuts.

      "text: Poured from 12oz bottle. Review from notes.A- Pours a nice amber color. One and a half finger light tan head dies down fast. Left light lacing on the sides of the glass. Nothing special with this beer....kind of bleh looking actually.S- The aroma proved to be a little better than the apperance. Light roasted bittersweet malts clash with some light caramel malts. More earthy than floral hops in the middle to ending aroma. This wasn't too powerful in the nose but you could pick up these scents without burying your nose in the glass.T- Light toasted malts in the front end of this right off the bat. Caramel malts follow into the middle with some light citrus flavor. Earthy hops on the backend of this beer doesn't really shine at all and falls short of the aroma. M- Light mouthfeel. Carbonation is high for the style I think. Goes with the beer sadly though. Light roasted malts left on the palate with some hop lingering in the aftertaste. Light drying on the palate and somewhat clean tasting. D- This is a drinkable beer and high at that. This has to do with the fact that there isn't a high flavor in this. Good drinker for someone who is just starting into craft beer. Also, good for someone who wants to drink import but not something from BMC.\n",

But since this beer is classified as just a bitter and not an ESB I need to rethink my perception of what this beer should be. It has hops but not to the extreme. It has flavor, good aroma, and tastes good. I am happy to have drunk my first bitter.St Patrick Rules!\n",

A wall of lace stuck to the side of the glass.The aroma was primarily sweet malt with just a hint of hops. No off notes.The taste had a very mild hop bitterness but was so balancesd that only a little malt sweetness comes through. Again there were no off flavors.The mouthfeel was light to medium light with a tingle of carbonation on the tongue.I found this bitters a delightful way to spend time in the airport.\n",

I was assured this was a nice pub brew, but the thing was about as close to smelling and drinking natural gas as I'm sure one can get. I could barely toss this back out of consideration. I hardly ever review something like this. No beer smell, no beer taste, just the appearance of beer.Someday, I'll likely give this another chance, just to check and be 100% fair.\n",

      "text: When landlords set up bars for students, they know damn well that most of their profit will be turned from flogging bland lagers and those luridly coloured sugar solutions that were mixed with fruit flavouring and some cheap vodka and deemed Â‘fashionable.Â’ For the tiny percentage of students who want a real ale, they either provide TetleyÂ’s Smooth-Flow Bitter or CaffreyÂ’s Irish Ale. I feel somewhat insulted by this. CaffreyÂ’s has a slightly offensive, sugary taste that makes it difficult to drink compared to other ales. It is however quite well-balanced. The aroma is nutty yet not too over-consuming.Overall this is an average beer, made more sub-standard by becoming too commercialised.\n",

Flavour contains a cidery apple/pear along with sweet, almost bready malt. A bit of hops come out on the finish, but are slight. All that said and done, the mouthfeel is on the oily side, and the overall experience is actually not very impressive. Far better English ales out there to quaff and save for session brews.

Unfortunately the taste and smell does not match the appearance; the smell is stale and the taste somewhat hard to define, but definitely leaving a sense of sourness. No hops are noted in the brew at all. The mouthfeel is creamy yet bland in its residual palate sense. Watery liquor taste. Not a pleasing taste to be sure; won't go back.\n",

Hint of fruity esters, floral hop and diacetyl with a thin caramel malt aroma. At first the mouth feel is smooth and creamy but further down the pint it seems and carbonation is non-existent and gains a watery texture. Body feels a bit thin, malt flavour is in the form of a steel caramel malt and lightly kilned graininess. Hops bring an ample bitterness with a trailing leafy flavour.This ends up to be a beer that needs to be consumed quickly. It loses its luscious texture the more the nitro pulls away from the liquid.\n",

No freshness date.Appearance: Pours a lively, waving, cascading brew -- awesome to watch. When it settles the liquor is amber with light red hues and the head is a solid finger's width of creamy white foam that sticks all over the inside of the glass. Head stays all the way to the bottom of the glass.Smell: Floral sweetness with a dry, raw coarseness about it.Taste: Incredibly smooth, creamy and full. There's a near dextrin malt sweetness that is full of herbal and floral flavours that are rather tasty. Hops get mildly coarse and raw on the palate, then the brew dries up for a brief moment with a slight lemon/salt-like hop bitterness. The palate is soon quenched with the smoothness of more light sweet malts that hold a faint toasted flavour and background (way back) grape fruitiness. Aftertaste is unusually neutral when still chilled, dry and coarse when warmed.Notes: I don't care what anyone says, Caffrey's is a fine beverage and so easy to put down that it often scares me. A Friday lunchtime favourite for my buddy Dee and I. We always have 2 or 10.\n",

Minimalist but well designed.Appearance: super creamy pour - very white to start but slowly changes to a clear amber colour. Medium thick white head that leaves some lace as it ever so slowly drops. Looks good!Aroma: what aroma? Not much there at all. I know it's a mid strength, but one would expect a bit more than just a light toffee malt on the nose. Disappointing after the pour.Taste: follows the nose, I'm afraid. It does have those trademark red ale characteristics of earthy hops, toffee-caramel malts and a touch of some barley, but it is simply far too weak for my liking.Aftertaste: not much here either - disappears from the palate too quickly for an expensive red ale.Mouth feel: mouth feel is light to moderate in body with a lower carbonation. Slightly smooth, but not as creamy as the full-strength versions.Overall: the best way to describe this beer is with but one word: boring. If it was in fact a premium 5%+ beer it would probably be alright. The right flavours are there, they are just way too muted. Add to that a price tag over AU$75 for an equivalent case of 24 x 330mL, and you've gotta be joking.\n",

      "text: Caffrey's Irish Ale, the &quot;white Guinness&quot; as I used to call it, used to have 4.8% ABV as well, and much like Guinness it is slowly working its way down to mid-strength. It's sad to see brewers do this to their beers and I can only see a drop in flavour is to better serve the masses of people that don't drink beer and never will regardless of the flavour whereas the avid beer drinkers (such as myself) are losing out. Anyway let's see how badly the flavour has suffered since the last time I had it it was 4.8% ABV.Poured from a 440ml nitro-can into a nonic pint.A: Nitro beers always look fantastic and the Caffrey's is no exception with it's deep copper body and perfect 1cm creamy white head.S: Toasted barley malts are foremost on the nose, with a hint of brewers yeast, some light earthy hops [read: very light earthy hops] and the effervescence of spring water. T: Boring as tap water. I know that this beer used to have a flavour profile but really now it just tastes watered down. Yes it has barley malt, yeast, hops and water, but they can at least make it interesting God-dammit. It does have a slight dry toasted barley after taste, which is just as well because you wouldn't know it was a beer otherwise.M: Mid to light body, flat carbonation, texture of water with a small amount of beer added.D: This is a very typical Irish ale, like Kikenny, et al... I have difficulty distinguishing between these beers after years of drinking full flavoured pale ales. Well the verdict is: this used to be a decent Irish pub beer but has suffered at the hands of corporate-greed/marketing-to-teenagers and as a result it is now tap water that contains alcohol: disappointing.Food match: I would have previously said &quot;Irish pub fare, stews and shepherds pie&quot; but now (at the new flavourless 3.8% ABV version) I say plain crackers with cream cheese for dipping... also make sure that cream cheese doesn't have any added flavourings.\n",

I used to drink this stuff like water on tap back in the day after university obligations were fulfilled, at least for the day, in those natty nineties.This beer pours a clear, medium golden amber hue, with two fingers of creamy, foamy off-white head, which leaves some sparse, broad swaths of bubbly lace around the glass as it slowly seeps away.It smells of sweet, sugary, grainy malt, with a touch of treacle, caramel, a mild orchard fruitiness, and very, very soft leafy hops. The taste is weak grainy, bready malt, a slight toastiness, faint yeast, muddled, plain drupe fruit esters, and muffled noble hops.The carbonation is very laid back, sleepy, and yet not flat-seeming, the body a less than solid medium weight, and of course, pretty damned smooth, in just that eerie Irish ale manner. It finishes off-dry, the lingering underwhelming bready malt really suffering nothing in the way of challenge.Not the grandest of rip-snortingly pungent flavours going on here, I suppose, but perhaps this isn't the venue for such a thing - the Irish, and we willing tourists and diaspora, if I recall correctly, use this type of watery sideshow as a respected moderator for their Whiskey habit. I sure could go for some of the latter, as a matter of fact.\n",

A finger of nitro-assisted white head is there and doesn't dissipate at all. Some very mild lacing. Some floral hops with a lot of caramel in the smell. Flavour actually has more bitterness than I remember, some sweetness as well. Creamy mouthfeel from the nitro. This is an ok beer, nothing special though.\n",

I didn't get much in the way of aroma but the toffee and malt flavour was really enjoyable. Carbonation is low and very fine. The problem with this is quaffability. I can smash down a whole pint before I can even taste it so drinkability is huge. There's not a whole lot going on in terms of complexity and it is a bit watery but this suits me as long as the flavour is there and though the toffee and caramel is subdued it's still there and balanced. Good but not great.\n",

Popping the can released a satisfying woosh and pouring revealed a creamy beer with a lovely head. The appearance suggested this would be a wonderfully smooth drink.The first thing that I noticed upon taking a sip was how flat the beer is. There is absolutley no carbonation, maybe due to the nirto-can approach. The taste was equally flat and dull. In fact, I could barely discern any taste whatsoever.More sips revealed nothing intereting whatsoever. It's the most unrewarding beer I've ever sampled. I bought a 12 pack for Â£8, making each can only 66p. So I've no probelms in giving the rest away or pouring it down the sink. A complete waste of drinking time.\n",

As the beer warms, faint scents of pilsner malt and graininess begin to emmit. Maybe a floral, spicy hop but boy is this streatching it. The beer really has no meaningful aroma.Flavors are ...well even more obscure than the aroma. The beer has a thin malt-grain flavor mixed with a looot of water. Hop flavor is extremely low and helps just a touch. Maybe a fresh baked bread or dough taste? I've had mineral water with this much taste.Mouthfeel, you guessed it, very watery with only a very light reminescent of malt. Bitterness is also extremely low. The creamy carbonation bailed ship long ago and hardly contributes to and creaminess or roundness. It must be tough to make a beer this bland and flavorless.

Clean finish.Mouthfeel - low carbonation, very, very, very smooth. Extremely smooth.Drinkability - very good and I would definitely recommend. This is a bit expensive for a 4-pack but definitely a good beer that helps remind that spring is coming.\n",

      "text: 20oz draught4.20% ABVI tried this beer on March 15, 2008 at 'McCabe's Irish Pub' in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The beer was a nice translucent orange/gold colour with a thick, creamy white head that lasted throughout the experience. The aroma was primarily malt with a slight hoppish hint. The mouthfeel was thick, and creamy, with very light carbonation. When taking into account the lack of carbonation, the flavour was nothing more than malted water. One could easily drink 5-6 of these as they go down easy...on this day, one was enough for me.\n",

However don't judge the book by it's cover was evident here.I couldn't smell anything from this beer, very bland on the nose. No fruit or even hops or bitter scent.This theme of blandness continued through to the taste, at least this beer was consistent.The mouthfeel at first was promising until about a third of the way through the pint. Man this was a meal in itself, way too thick for my taste and I like full bodied ales.I forced it down, but I wouldn't try another. Not disgusting just very thick water. How is this so readily available???Whilst in Ireland I tried both Smidicks and Kilkenny and thought that these were both superior.\n",

The head stays down to the bottom of the glass and leaves good lacing; classic nitro, except for the odd whistling farty noise when I opened the can. Smell is faint, with floral hops and some caramel as well. Taste is caramel and roasted malts, with a slight hop finish. The mouthfeel is pretty thin and watery, and flat as well, but not terribly so. It just lacks the usual creaminess that is the upside of the trade off between appearance/mouthfeel and taste/smell. The drinkability is very good though.\n",

The aroma is quite muted, but there's some caramel maltiness, a hint of fruit, and some floral hops. The mild flavour is matched by low bitterness. Caramel malt and light fruit start things off, with hops kicking in towards the finish. Low carbonation (of course) with a light body and a dry texture, especially as it warms. This is a great session beer, especially on nitro-tap... not very complex, but tasty enough to have several.\n",

      "text: Poured a promising amber with a luxurious nitro head... The reverse cascade of bubbles gives away the nitro-charged deliver system. It leaves a thick, dense creamy head that lasts the entire brew.The smell was all fruit and malt with a mild bready note. No real hops to speak of in the nose.The taste is full bodied and creamy smooth. There's quite a bit of fruit in this amber ale, lots of peach, plum and raisin sweetness along with a sweet bready note. After weeks of West Coast hops this ale seems almost hop-free but in reality it's got a subtle showing of fuggles or golding to add a small amount of balance.Despite the thick, long lasting head the mouthfeel was disappointing. The brew itself was essentially flat but covered with a fluffy nitro head. There was no carbonation (nitrogenation?) to provide effervescence to clean the palate and with a pretty weak hopping there just wasn't much of a finish to each sip.This is a very tasty beer and certainly a nice low ABV session beer. It's got all the good characteristics of an ale from the British Isles with the typical hearty amber ale fruitiness. A bit more hops and it would have been a part of the regular rotation.\n",

Came out a deep dark clear burgundy under a one finger tan head that was very creamy and full of body. This head lingered literally to the bottom of the glass (with 1/4 centimeter of liquid left, there was still 1/2 centimeter of foam!). Beautiful sheets of lace completed the visual experience. The nose was way too mild, however, to the point of being almost imperceptible. The mouth was heavily carbonated, and heavy bodied. The taste was about right - roasted malt, almonds, plums and cherries. The finish had some hops, but not enough for my taste. The aftertaste was roasty, with a touch of bitterness. A solid product, but nothing spectacular after the great optics.\n",

This beer has a small baby finger head that leaves mild lacing with good evidence of carbonation.Smell â€“ Good malty aroma with hints of citrus. There is also some sweetness from the honey but no notes of the ginger in the nose.Taste â€“ Again like the nose good malt flavours to begin with a little sour hops at the back of the tongue. This is followed by a spicy hint of ginger but this is extremely mild. The honey in the brew combines with the hops to give a burnt toffee like front while the finish is sour citrus.Mouthfeel â€“ Medium body with good linger and nice coating of the throat.Overall â€“ This one is very drinkable. It is mild and easy while still retaining good flavour. This is still available in Northern Ireland (as of September 2014) and I have contacted the brewery to enquire about its status. If it is not retired I will certainly be getting some again.\n",

Slight hint of earthy hops and sweet caramel.Taste â€“ Pretty much follows the smell. Definite apple fruitiness, earthy hops so there is almost a woody/nutty flavour riding through it. Good sweet biscuit and caramel flavour so it is all nicely balanced and a riot of flavour Mouthfeel â€“ Thin in the mouth owing to its smaller head, good carbonation for the style. Dry and a slight astringency from the sour apples nip at the back end.Overall â€“ A cracking beer. The fresh ingredients from the kingdom of Mourne make this a very fresh feeling drink. Good for a night out, I must confess to having more than a few on the first time I tried this it is a very good example of the style and certainly a good ambassador for Northern Irish craft brewing.\n",

      "text: The first time I had this was at The Crown Bar in Belfast. It s from cask , and I was extremely impressed at how fresh and hoppy it tasted. The head was at least three fingers high. It was a great example of local beer done right, I have to say. I decided to try it from a 500l ml bottle. Slightly differentPoured into Heineken pint glass. Two finger head. Pleasant chestnut color. Head remains for a while and lacing persists all the way down. Smells biscuity, slightly hoppy, fresh. I can't wait to have a swig of this.Taste is different from cask. NO hops but I expected that as most cask brewers from what I ve been told, throw a huge wad of fresh leaf hops in before tapping a cask. Fresh, bready, sweet caramel finish. I could drink a good few of these.Has a medium body, what one would expect from a session beer. Carbonation matches the style perfectly. Nuff saidOverall, different out of the bottle but still pleasant to drink. I was surprised by the caramel finish. I will definitely pick up a few more of these the next time I come across this fine beer. Now I m not saying that this is a great beer, but my enthusiasm for this example comes from the fact that it is a local Northern Irish brewery staying true to what they know how to do.\n",

They only started bottled less than a month ago as far as I know after speaking with the brewer, so lets see how its translated to bottlePours with a lighter body than the cask version, rich coppery with amber hues. Tight off white head with good retention, some small patches of lacing down the glass. This isnt bottle conditioned sadly and is filtered so no signs of hazeSmell, carmelly malt, some dried fruits, spiced figs, brown sugar, fresh wort, a few esters and very slight alcohol on the noseTaste, sweet and crisp, chewy and biscuity malt, nice smooth lasting bitterness on the finish. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, maybe a little overly carbonated like alot of english ales when they are bottled but leave it a few mins if you want a more cask-like mouthfeelNot as good as the cask version but still very good, very drinkable as usual and good to be able to access this at home\n",

Earthy hops with chocolate and espresso coffee smell.Taste â€“ Really good roasted flavours from the barley and malts and these are well balanced by the smoothness imparted by the oats. It has a nice bitter edge but it is not over powering. The coffee flavours are really very mild in this one but there is strong dark chocolate flavour.Mouthfeel â€“ Metalic and a little thin but it has good linger and is towards the dry end of the scale.Overall â€“ A good solid stout with balanced flavour. This beer is not overly strong on any front but it is confident and well balanced. It does lack the creaminess of Guinness Draught and the bold flavour of Guinness Extra but it has great chocolate notes and is quite like Brains Original Stout.\n",

An intriguing touch of rust also wakes up to each swirl. Overall, richer in aroma than I had imagined for this beer style.T: dry and bitter from the beginning, besides the full flavour and rounded aroma of roasted barley and black malts, charred nuts and even crushed coffee beans, there goes a subtle dark-fruits like acidity and a flow of earthy/herbal/nutty bitterness to caress the wings of the tongue, leaving behind a long, aromatic, lightly chewy-spicy bitter aftertaste, as a vivid reminder of both the depth of roasted malts and the hop elements.M&amp;D: clean on the palate, although in the long finish a chewy feel doesnâ€™t go unnoticed, this moderately-carbonated, medium-bodied, smooth dry stout lives up to the standard and expectation, that itâ€™s dry, sufficiently bitter, at the same time retaining a solid body without tasting thin like many other stouts. Iâ€™d really love to try its cask-conditioned version, which I think would be just sublime and definitely a favourite session stout!\n",
